title: Controlling access to the Streaming Analytics application
layout: redirect
---

By default, the Streaming Analytics application gives you access to the **Analytics Builder** and **EPL Apps** pages.
Administrators may wish to control which of these are shown on different tenants or for different users,
or modify the wording of the cards on the home screen, see also [Customizing the home screen of the Streaming Analytics application](/streaming-analytics/analytics-customization/#customize-home-screen).

Which pages are available also depends on the variant of the Apama-ctrl microservice that is running.

- If the microservice is not running, an error message is shown indicating that the microservice cannot be accessed,
and only a card with information about smart rules is shown on the home screen.
- If the Apama-ctrl-starter microservice is running, the **EPL Apps** page is not shown (and cannot be enabled)
as the EPL apps functionality is not available in Apama-ctrl-starter.
- If the Apama-ctrl-mt-4c-16g microservice is running, the **Analytics Builder** page is not shown (and cannot be enabled).
In this case, only the **EPL Apps** page is shown.
- If the Apama-ctrl-smartrules or Apama-ctrl-smartrulesmt microservice is running, neither the **Analytics Builder** nor the **EPL Apps** page is shown (and cannot be enabled).
In this case, only the card with information about smart rules is shown on the home screen.
- For other variants of the Apama-ctrl microservice, both the **Analytics Builder** and **EPL Apps** pages are shown by default.

For an entire tenant, if a "feature application" named `feature-disable-analyticsbuilder` and/or `feature-disable-eplapps` is
available within the tenant, then the relevant part is disabled. This can be done either within a tenant or by an {{< enterprise-tenant >}} or {{< management-tenant >}} (see also [Managing tenants](/enterprise-tenant/managing-tenants/))
and then subscribing to subtenants (the subtenant administrators are then not able to unsubscribe this application if the parent tenant wishes
to restrict access to the functionality). To create such a "feature application" within a tenant, send a POST request to `/application/applications`
(as an administrator with the permission to create applications). For example, to disable Analytics Builder:

```
{
   "name":"feature-disable-analyticsbuilder",
   "contextPath": "feature-disable-analyticsbuilder",
   "type":"HOSTED",
   "resourcesUrl":"/",
   "manifest": {
       "noAppSwitcher": true
   },
   "key":"feature-disable-analyticsbuilder-key"
}
```

Or to disable EPL Apps:

```
{
   "name":"feature-disable-eplapps",
   "contextPath": "feature-disable-eplapps",
   "type":"HOSTED",
   "resourcesUrl":"/",
   "manifest": {
       "noAppSwitcher": true
   },
   "key":"feature-disable-eplapps-key"
}
```

You can also send the POST request using a curl command, for example, to disable Analytics Builder:

```
curl --user username -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"feature-disable-analyticsbuilder", "contextPath": "feature-disable-analyticsbuilder", "type":"HOSTED", "resourcesUrl":"/","manifest": {"noAppSwitcher": true},"key":"feature-disable-analyticsbuilder-key"}' -k https://{{hostname}}/application/applications/
```

Or to disable EPL Apps:
```
curl --user username -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"feature-disable-eplapps", "contextPath": "feature-disable-eplapps", "type":"HOSTED", "resourcesUrl":"/", "manifest": {"noAppSwitcher": true},"key":"feature-disable-eplapps-key"}' -k https://{{hostname}}/application/applications/
```

By default, all users can see the same set of pages (according to the limitations above).
You can also restrict the visibility of the pages to only users who have the permission ROLE_ANALYTICSBUILDER_READ or ROLE_EPLAPPS_READ,
which can be assigned directly to users or via groups, see also [Managing permissions](/standard-tenant/managing-permissions/).
To enable this, set the category of the tenant option to `streaminganalytics` and the `applicationAccess` key to the value "role", see the [Tenant API](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/#tag/Tenant-API) in the {{< openapi >}}, or use a curl command as given in the example below:

```
curl --user username -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"category": "streaminganalytics", "key": "applicationAccess", "value": "role"}' -k https://mytenant/tenant/options
```

You must replace the username with the name of a user who has ADMIN permission for "Option management".

Note that this only affects the visibility of the cards and pages in the Streaming Analytics application.
The [supported REST services](/streaming-analytics/epl-apps/#supported-rest-services) only require READ and ADMIN permissions for "CEP management".
