**Example**

In the following screenshot, five columns are configured. Three property columns "Name", "Owner", and "Type", which refer to the properties "name", "owner" and "type" respectively. Additionally, there are two actions, one for toggling the maintenance mode, and one for rebooting the device.

![Asset table widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-table.png)

The resulting table is visualized as follows:
![Asset table widget example](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-table-example.png)

#### To add properties {#to-add-properties}

Click **+Add Properties** and select one or more properties to be added.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The property "Active alarm status" shows active alarms as icons in the table. If you select this property, you also must configure the renderer "Active Alarm Status" in the list of columns.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To add actions {#to-add-actions}

1. Click **+Add Action**.
1. Select **Toggle maintenance mode** to add the predefined action to toggle the maintenance mode.
1. Select **Create operation** to create a button that will execute a shell command. In the resulting dialog box you can then enter the label for the button and the shell command to be executed.

![Reboot device button configuration](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-table-buttonconfig.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The dialog shows the predefined shell commands of the first device that supports shell commands. The list is empty if there is no such device. For more details, refer to [Shell](/device-management-application/viewing-device-details/#shell).<br>
You can also enter the JSON format for the operation that will be sent to the device. For details, contact the device vendor for supported operations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To modify the table {#to-modify-the-table}

To edit the header of a column, click on its value in the **Label** column and edit the label.

You can rearrange the columns by clicking the icon at the very left of a row and dragging and dropping the entry.

To remove a property or an action, hover over the respective row and click **Delete** at the right.

### Data point graph {#data-point-graph}

The "Data point graph" widget shows a data point (measurement) in a graph. The visualization is the same as in the [data explorer](/cockpit/data-explorer/).

![Data Point Graph widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-datapointsgraph-widget.png)

The easiest way to create a "Data point graph" widget is to navigate to the data explorer, click the <b>More...</b> button in the top menu bar and select <b>Send as widget to dashboard</b>.

Refer to [Changing visualization](/cockpit/data-explorer/#changing-visualization) for further details on the parameters to be configured.

### Data point list {#data-point-list}

### Data point table {#data-point-table}

The "Data point table" widget configuration is similar to the "Data point graph" widget, but instead of visualizing the data as a line-chart, data is visualized as a table.

The "Data point table" widget displays data based on selected data points, time interval and aggregation.

Out of range values, based on configured yellow and red ranges, are highlighted in the table.

![Data point table](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-datapointtable.png)

At the top right of the data point list, an **Auto scroll** toggle determines the display behavior:

* Auto-scroll on - When a new measurement arrives, the widget automatically scrolls to the top so that you can see the latest value.
* Auto-scroll off - When a new measurement arrives, the display does not change and the table still shows the same snippet of data.

![Auto-scroll toogle](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-data-point-table-widget-with-auto-scroll.png)

### Event list {#event-list}

The "Event list" widget lets you monitor events for a selected device.

![Event list widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-event-list.png)

### Info Gauge {#info-gauge}

The "Info gauge" widget visualizes one data point in form of a radial gauge and multiple data points as labels.

![Info gauge widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-info-gauge.png)

You can select one data point for the gauge, and multiple data points shown with labels at the left side.

You must enable at least one data point in each section to create the "Info gauge" widget.

### HTML {#html}

The "HTML" widget shows user-defined content. The content can be formatted using HTML.

**Parameters to configure**

* Target assets or devices: Select the objects for which optional HTML expressions are evaluated.

* HTML code

	The following variables can be used inside the HTML content:

	* {{devicesCount}}: Total number of devices.

	* {{usersCount}}: Total number of users.

	* {{deviceGroupsCount}}: Total number of groups.

	* {{device.name}}: The name of the device.

	* {{device.*property*}}: More general form of the above. You can address any property of the device.

	* {{devices[*deviceId*].name}}: The name of the device at the specified index.

	* {{devices[*deviceId*].*property*}}: More general form of the above. You can address any property of the device at the specified index.

"Device" refers to the target device, as selected in the widget configuration parameter.<br>
"fragment.property" refers to the properties of the respective device. To see the available property names, you can use the "Asset property" or "Asset table" widget and click **+Add property** in the widget configuration. This will show a table of supported properties. You can copy and paste the values from the column **Property**. Generated properties of these widgets are not available in the HTML widgets.

The following code sanitization options can be selected:
 - strict - Does not allow any JS or angularjs directives.
 - lax (default) - Allows partly JS (events) and all angularjs directives.
 - none - Allows everything.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The sanitization option "lax" includes a defined list of directives that are excluded from sanitization. For more examples on how to customize the sanitization options, see the help text toggle in the **HTML code** section.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

![HTML widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-html.png)

If you want to use a link in the **HTML code** field, for example a link to a dashboard, you must use the following format:

```html
  <a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="location.hash = '#/group/<<group-id>>/dashboard/<<dashboard-id>>'">link to another dashboard</a><br />
```

### Linear Gauge {#linear-gauge}

The "Linear gauge" widget visualizes data points in form of a linear gauge. Min and max target values are shown on the gauge as well.

![Info gauge widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-linear-gauge.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If a label is not properly readable, you can help yourself by increasing the min and max value of the data point to move the label into the readable range.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

You must enable at least one data point to create the "Linear gauge" widget.

### Map {#map}

The "Map" widget shows the location of a device or all devices of a group.

![Info gauge widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-map.png)

You can drag the map and move its content, and you can zoom in and out by using the **Plus** and **Minus** buttons.

The icons representing the devices are color-coded. The color used follows these rules:

* Red = At least one CRITICAL alarm
* Orange = At least one MAJOR alarm
* Yellow = At least one MINOR alarm
* Blue = At least one WARNING
* Green = No alarm

Click a device icon, to open a popup with the following information:

* The device name. When clicked, the application navigates to the device.
* The date at which the device last reported its location, if available.
* A toggle to show/hide the device tracks for the previous and current days.

**Parameters to configure**

* Target assets or devices: Select which devices are shown on the map. If a group is selected, all devices in that group (but not in any subgroups) are visible.
* Marker icon: Icon of the marker on the map.
* Zoom level: Default zoom level of the map.
* Center bound: The default map coordinates.
* Refresh interval: The refresh interval for the selected device or asset. If only one device is selected, instead of refresh interval, realtime option can be selected together with "follow selected" device toggle which would follow the device after location update.
