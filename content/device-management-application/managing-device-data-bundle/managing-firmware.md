In the firmware repository, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers to collect reference firmware for devices.

Only one firmware package version can be applied per device.

### To view firmware {#to-view-firmware}

Click **Firmware repository** in the **Management** menu in the navigator.

The available firmware objects will be displayed as a list.

![Firmware list](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-firmware-list.png)

Each entry shows the firmware name, the device type it is applicable for (if set), and a label indicating if and how many versions are available for a particular firmware.
At the left in the top menu bar, you can filter the repository entries by name, description or device type. For details on the filtering functionality, see [Search and filter functionality](/get-familiar-with-the-ui/gui-features/#search-and-filter-functionality).

When clicking on an entry, the details for this firmware are displayed along with all available versions and patches.

![Firmware details](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-firmware-details.png)

At the top, the firmware name, a description, and optional device type filter(s) are shown. If a filter is set, the firmware will show up for installation only for devices of that type. If no filter is set, it will be available for all devices.

The list of versions and patches shows the version name and the name of the firmware binary. Moreover, the list indicates if a firmware version has patches, which can be viewed by expanding the version entry. The versions and patches are ordered by their creation time (descending).

### To add a new firmware or firmware version {#to-add-a-new-firmware-or-firmware-version}

1. In the **Firmware repository** page, click **Add firmware** at the right of the top menu bar.
2. In the resulting dialog box,
	* to add a new firmware, enter a name for the firmware (and confirm it by clicking **Create new** in the resulting window), add a description and its version (all required).
	* to add a new version, select the firmware for which you want to add a new version from the dropdown list in the **Firmware** field and enter a version.

### To manage firmware on a device {#to-manage-firmware-on-a-device}

In the **Firmware** tab of a device you can manage the installed firmware for the device.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The **Firmware** tab shows up for a device if the device supports `c8y_Firmware` operations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Click **All devices** in the **Devices** menu in the navigator, select the desired device from the device list and open its **Firmware** tab.

The **Firmware** tab shows the current firmware installed on the device.

![Firmware tab](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-firmware-tab.png)

Additionally, it shows the operation status for the last operation (one of SUCCESSFUL, PENDING, EXECUTING, FAILED). Clicking on the operation will show you the operation details.

##### To install/replace firmware on a device {#to-installreplace-firmware-on-a-device}

1. In the **Firmware** tab, click **Install firmware** (or **Replace firmware** if there is already firmware installed on the device).
2. Select a firmware and the desired version from the list, which contains all firmware available for the particular device type (or the ones that have no device type) in the firmware repository.
3. Click **Install**.

The install operation to be executed by the device will be created. The firmware installation is completed as soon as the device has executed the operation.

Click on the operation to view its details. The status of the last operation is also shown on the **Firmware** tab.

##### To install/update firmware on multiple devices {#to-installupdate-firmware-on-multiple-devices}

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers the option to execute firmware updates for multiple devices at once.

1. Execute the firmware operation (install or replace) on a single device to test that the new version works.
2. Navigate to the operation in the **Control** tab and in the context menu select **Schedule as bulk operation**.
3. Fill in the fields to schedule the bulk operation and click **Create**. For details on bulk operations, see [Monitoring and controlling devices](/device-management-application/monitoring-and-controlling-devices).
