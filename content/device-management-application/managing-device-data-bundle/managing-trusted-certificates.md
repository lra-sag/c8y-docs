{{< product-c8y-iot >}} allows devices to connect via MQTT protocol using a X.509 certificate for authentication. To do so, a certificate must be trusted by {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. A certificate is trusted when it is added to the trusted certificates and is in activated state.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This section describes how to manage trusted certificates. For information on connecting devices using certificates refer to [Device certificates](/device-integration/mqtt/#device-certificates).

### To add a certificate {#to-add-a-certificate}

Before adding a new trusted certificate, make sure that:

* It s a X.509 certificate in PEM format.
* It is in version 3.
* It contains `BasicConstraints:[CA:true]`.
* It has not already been uploaded to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
* It is still valid (not expired).

To add a certificate perform these steps:

1. Click **Add trusted certificate** at the right of the top menu bar.
2. In the resulting dialog box, provide the following information:

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Certificate name  | User-provided name for the certificate. This name is not used by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and can serve as a description of the certificate.         |
| Certificate       | File containing the certificate in PEM format. Add the file by dropping it into this field or browsing for it in your file system.            |
| Auto registration | If selected, new devices which use a certificate signed by the authority owning this trusted certificate will automatically be registered. |
| Enabled/ Disabled | When disabled, devices which use a certificate signed by the authority owning this certificate, will not be able to connect.               |

3. Click **Add Certificate** to validate and save the certificate.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
