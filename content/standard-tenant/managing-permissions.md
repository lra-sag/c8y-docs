  title: Managing permissions
  content: "Permissions define what a user is allowed to do in Cumulocity IoT applications. To manage permissions more easily, they are grouped into so-called 'roles'. Every user can be associated with a number of roles, adding up permissions of the user.


  In the **Global roles** tab you can find the roles which grant permissions on a general level. There are several global roles pre-defined (which may serve as a template), but you can define your own according to your needs.


  In the **Inventory roles** tab you can manage user permissions for particular groups of devices and/or its children. For example, an inventory role can contain the permission to restart a particular device."

Permissions define what a user is allowed to do in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} applications. To manage permissions more easily, they are grouped into global and inventory roles. Every user can be associated with a number of roles, adding up permissions of the user.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
ROLES & PERMISSIONS:

* To view global roles, inventory roles, applications: READ permission for the "User management" permission type.
* To manage global roles (assign to users, unassign from users), to manage inventory roles, to manage application access: ADMIN permission for the "User management" permission type.
* To assign owned roles to users ("feature-user-hierarchy" application subscription required): CREATE permission for the "User management" permission type.
* To create new roles with available (owned) permissions: CREATE and ADMIN permission.

The above permissions can be used to create roles for robust user management. Every new tenant have specified typical roles by default:
* Global User Manager - Can access and modify the full user hierarchy
* Shared User Manager - Can create new own sub-users and manage them ("feature-user-hierarchy" application subscription required)
