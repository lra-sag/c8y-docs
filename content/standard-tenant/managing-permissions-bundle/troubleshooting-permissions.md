If you try to perform actions without sufficient permissions, an error message will occur.

To help troubleshooting permissions, click the **User** button (showing the current user name) at the right of the top bar. From the context menu, select **Access denied requests**. In the resulting window details on the denied accesses are provided. An administrator user or the [product support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/) can help in fixing the permissions.
