Click **Roles** in the **Accounts** menu to display a list of configured roles.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-global-roles.png" alt="Context menu">

In the **Global roles** tab you can find the roles which grant permissions on a system level. There are several global roles pre-defined, but you can define your own according to your needs.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The pre-defined roles are configured as samples for a particular purpose. You may use them as a starting point and further adapt them to your individual needs.

On creating a new user, make sure that the global roles you assign to the user contain all necessary permissions relevant for this particular user in either of those roles assigned. Permissions from different roles are merged together when assigned to the same user. If, for example, a user only has the role "Cockpit User" (see below), the user is only able to access the Cockpit application and nothing more. But if you also assign inventory permission via some of the available roles, the user will get access to the whole inventory, such as devices, groups, and configurations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

The roles "admins" and "devices" have a special status:

<table>
<col style="width: 20%;">
<col style="width: 80%;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Role&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">admins</td>
<td align="left">Administrative permissions are enabled. The initial administrator, the first user created in a tenant, has this role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">devices</td>
<td align="left">Typical permission setup for devices. After registration, a device automatically has this role. Edit this role if your devices require less or more permissions, or assign other roles to your devices.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Furthermore, the following pre-configured roles are initially provided.

<th align="left">Role</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>

<td align="left">CEP Manager</td>
<td align="left">Can access all smart rules and event processing rules.</td>

<td align="left">Tenant Manager</td>
<td align="left">Can manage tenant-wide settings, such as own applications, data brokerage, data retention, options and tenant statistics.</td>

</tbody>
</table>

You may also see the following legacy roles:

|Role|Description|
|:---|:---|
|business|Can access all devices and their data but has no management permission in the tenant.
|readers|Can read all data (including users, in contrast to "Global Readers").

### To add a global role {#to-add-a-global-role}

Click **Add global role** in the **Global roles** tab. In the **New global role** page you will see a list of permission types at the left and a list of applications to be accessed at the right. The following screenshot shows the settings for the "admins" role.

![Admin example](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-global-role-admin.png)

**Permission levels**

For each type, you can select the following permission levels:

- READ - read the specified data.
- CREATE - create new data like users and inventory data and edit users within your hierarchy.
- UPDATE - change and delete the specified data (not including READ).
- ADMIN - create, update or delete the specified data.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
CREATE permissions are related to the concept of ownership in {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. If you have created an object, you are the owner of it and can manage it without requiring any further permissions. For example, if you have  CREATE permission for "Inventory", you can create devices and groups, and fully manage these devices and groups. You cannot manage any devices or groups that you did not create yourself, unless you also have the UPDATE permission or an additional inventory role (see below). This concept helps to assign minimal permissions to devices. It also enables you to limit user management permissions to sub-users, if you subscribed to user hierarchies.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Select the checkbox at the top of a column to set the respective level to all permission types.

**Permission categories**

The following permission categories are available by default:

There may be additional permissions visible depending on the features in your subscription plan. These are documented along with the respective feature.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
When new features with new permissions are added to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, these are not automatically added to existing roles. If you notice that you cannot use a new feature that was recently announced, check your permissions.

### To assign global roles {#to-assign-global-roles}

You can assign global roles to users either directly in the user list, or by opening the details page for a particular user and adding them there.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
By default it is not possible to change roles of SSO users (created automatically during SSO login) as those would be overridden by dynamic access mapping. However this behaviour can be changed. For more information refer to [Custom template configuration](/authentication/sso/#custom-template).
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}
