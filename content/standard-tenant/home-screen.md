The Home screen of the Administration application provides the following content:

* Your capacity usage for the current and for the last month
* The optional applications you are subscribed to

The capacity sections show:

* API requests - the total number of API requests, counting whenever some function in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} is invoked, regardless of whether the function is invoked from a device (for example sending a measurement) or from an application (for example viewing the list of devices).
* Device API requests - counting only when the API is called from a device (for example sending a measurement).
* Storage - the total amount of data stored in your account. This amount can be changed by [retention rules](/standard-tenant/managing-data/#retention-rules) and by the amount and size of [stored files](/standard-tenant/managing-data/#files-repository).
* Root devices - the number of root devices connected to your account, excluding child devices.
* Devices - the total number of devices connected to your account. This is the sum of the devices listed in the [All devices](/device-management-application/viewing-all-devices/) page of the Device management application and their direct and indirect child devices.
* Users - the sum of all users configured in this account, active and inactive.
