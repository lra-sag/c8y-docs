Click **Files repository** in the **Management** menu to see a list of files.

The files listed can come from various sources. They can be software images, configuration snapshots taken from devices, log files from devices or web applications uploaded from the **All applications** page.

For each file, the name of the file, its owner, its type (for example, image/bmp, text/csv), its size and its last update date are displayed. If file type is supported, you can click a magnifier icon next to the file name to preview it. You can download or delete a file by clicking action buttons which appear when hovering over the file row. Note that some files (for example, application archives) cannot be deleted from this page.

You can use filters or search input to look for particular files, see [Search and filter functionality](/get-familiar-with-the-ui/gui-features/#search-and-filter-functionality) for details. By default, files are sorted by **File name**. To change the sorting, remove the default filter and define your own criteria for filtering the list.
