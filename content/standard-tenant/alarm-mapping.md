The alarm type provided as an alarm mapping is interpreted as alarm type prefix: &quot;&#60;type-prefix&#62;*&quot;. If you create, for example, an alarm mapping to address alarms of type &quot;crit-alarm&quot;, the mapping is effective for any type of alarm that starts with this value e.g. &quot;crit-alarm-1&quot;, &quot;crit-alarm-2&quot;, or &quot;crit-alarm-xyz&quot;.
