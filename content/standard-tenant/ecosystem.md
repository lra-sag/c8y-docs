The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform distinguishes between applications and microservices, see also [Developing applications](/concepts/applications).

* [Applications](#managing-applications) -  all web applications either subscribed to the tenant or owned by the tenant.

* [Microservices](#managing-microservices) - server-side applications used to develop further functionality on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Both can be accessed via the **Ecosystem** menu in the navigator.

Additionally, in {{< enterprise-tenant >}}s, it is possible to configure **Default subscriptions**, that means you can specify a list of applications that are subscribed by default to every new tenant on creation and/or to all existing tenants on platform upgrade. For details, see [Default subscriptions](/enterprise-tenant/managing-tenants/#default-subscriptions).

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
ROLES & PERMISSIONS:

* To view applications and microservices: READ permission for the "Application management" permission type
* To manage applications and microservices (create, update, copy, delete): ADMIN permission for the "Application management" permission type

On tenant creation there are default roles available that can be used as sample configuration for the above mentioned permissions:
* Tenant Manager - manages tenant-wide configurations like applications, tenant options and business rules.

Note that for complete application management some additional permission types with different permission levels might be required per feature, for example:
* [Default subscriptions](/enterprise-tenant/managing-tenants/#default-subscriptions) for the {{< enterprise-tenant >}} additionally requires READ and ADMIN permissions for the "Option management" permission type.
* [Subscribing applications](/enterprise-tenant/managing-tenants/#subscribing-applications) for the {{< enterprise-tenant >}} additionally requires READ and ADMIN permissions for the "Tenant management" permission type.
