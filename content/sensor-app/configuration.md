If you want to make changes to the settings of the smartphone or a connected Bluetooth device, simply tap the 3 dots at the top right of the card for this device. Various options will be displayed at bottom of the screen. For Bluetooth devices, the options **Disconnect**, **Disable** and **Edit** are available. The smartphone itself only has the **Disable** and **Edit** options.

Tapping **Disconnect** removes a Bluetooth device from your smartphone entirely.

Tapping **Disable** still allows the smartphone to monitor measurements from this device, but stops sending sensor measurements to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Tapping **Edit**, or swiping upwards, reveals further settings that allow you to adjust various properties about this sensor, such as its name and update intervals.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Smaller update intervals provide better response times and more complete measurement data, but also lead to higher power usage.
