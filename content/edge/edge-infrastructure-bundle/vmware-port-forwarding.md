Ensure that the **Virtual machine IP address** is the same as the IP address that you have configured for the Edge appliance.
	{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

	|Host Port|Type|VM IP Address|VM Port|Description
	|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
	|443|TCP|192.168.117.10|443|HTTPS
	|1883|TCP|192.168.117.10|1883|MQTT
	|8883|TCP|192.168.117.10|8883|MQTT over SSL

	Click **OK** in the **Map Incoming Port** window after entering the port forwarding rules for each port.
