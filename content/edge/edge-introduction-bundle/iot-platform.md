Since {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge is based on the same software as the cloud-based {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform version, the included applications are the same in both versions, with minor restrictions.

For general information about functionalities and features of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, see [Get familiar with the UI](/get-familiar-with-the-ui/ui-introduction/).

Below you can find the links to the most common functionalities of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
