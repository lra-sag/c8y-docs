Data broker in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge does not support synchronization of the [operations](/concepts/domain-model/#operations).
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

To upload the data to a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant account, you must first create a data connector in the Edge appliance and subscribe this connector in the tenant account.

A data connector describes the subset of the data that you would like to send to a destination tenant. For more information, see [Data connectors](/data-broker/data-broker-application/#data-connectors).

To create a data connector and upload the data to the tenant account, perform the following steps:

1. In your Edge applaince, log in to the *edge* tenant.

2. In your Edge appliance, go to the Administration application. Click **Data broker** > **Data connectors**.

3. Click **Add data connector** and provide all the information and filters. See [To add a data connector](/data-broker/data-broker-application/#to-add-a-data-connector).

   Note down the security code. This security code will be used to subscribe the connector in the tenant account.

4. Log in to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant account.

5. In the tenant account, go to the Administration application. Click **Data broker** > **Data subscriptions** to subscribe the connector created in your Edge appliance.

   Click **Add data subscription** and provide the security code. Click **Submit** and accept the subscription. See [Data subscriptions](/data-broker/data-broker-application/#data-subscriptions).

   You can now navigate to the Device Management application or the Cockpit application. You will find a new “virtual group” with a specific icon showing the forwarded devices. The group will have the same name as your subscription.
