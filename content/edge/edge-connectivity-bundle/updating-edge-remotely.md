You can remotely update your Edge appliance using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s firmware update feature. This process requires you to upload the Edge archive file (tar.gz) to your tenant account or a server (you must provide the location of the archive on that server). For more information about the firmware feature, see [Managing firmware](/device-management-application/managing-device-data/#managing-firmware).

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
The Edge archive file size is about 3GB. If your tenant account has a limitation for uploading files with size over 1GB, contact Software AG support to increase the maximum file size for upload.
