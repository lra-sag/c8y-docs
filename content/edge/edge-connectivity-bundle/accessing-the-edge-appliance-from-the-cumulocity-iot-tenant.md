The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Cloud Remote Access allows you to remotely access the Edge appliance through a web browser. The remote Edge appliance is represented as a device in the Device Management application of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To use Cloud Remote Access, you need:

* "Remote access" permission granted to the tenant user.
* A {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant subscribed to the Cloud Remote Access microservice. To get the subscription, contact [{{< company-sag >}} support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/).

### Supported protocols {#supported-protocols}

The following protocols are supported to connect to the Edge appliance through remote access from the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant:

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}

Starting with {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge Release 10.15, the support for the Telnet protocol has been removed, as Telnet is considered to be an insecure protocol lacking built-in security measures. For accessing the Edge appliance remotely from the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant, {{< company-sag >}} recommends you to use the SSH protocol instead.
