With the Branding feature, you can fully customize the look of your tenant to your own preferences.

In the **Branding** tab, you can configure various parameters like logos, colors and font types used throughout the platform.

The [parameters](#configuration-parameters) are configured at the left side of the tab while you can see your changes applied to a preview extract at the right side.
