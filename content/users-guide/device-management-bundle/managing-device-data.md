{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The **Software type** field suggests you a list of types already used in your software repository. Before you consider defining a new software type (the field accepts new values directly) check if the type you need has already been defined before for another software by looking at the suggestions in the dropdown. This will help you keep software types consistent within your organization. If you use, for example, container images you may look for `container` or `image`, or try to search for more specific types like `docker`, `lxc`, and so on. This may prevent you from scattering your software types and using different names for effectively the same software type.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

The list of versions shows the version name and the name of the software binary.
The versions are ordered by their creation time (descending).

#### To add a new software or software version

1. In the **Software repository** page, click **Add software** at the right of the top menu bar.

Click **Update configuration** to save your changes.

#### To delete a configuration snapshot

To delete a configuration snapshot, click on the menu icon at the right of the row and then click **Delete**.

The configuration snapshot will be deleted from the configuration snapshot repository.

#### To retrieve and apply a configuration snapshot

Managing configurations, that is requesting a configuration from a device and sending a configuration to a device, can be done in multiple ways. Depending on user permissions and device settings, you can work with text based, typed file-based or legacy file-based configuration. Refer to [Device integrator library > Configuration](/reference/device-integrator-library/#configuration) in the *Reference guide* for more detailed and technical information.

#### To retrieve and apply a configuration snapshot to a device which supports typed file-based configuration

We recommend you to use typed file-based configuration. With typed file-based configuration, devices can manage multiple configurations at the same time. You can upload or retrieve different configurations for different types. Using this approach is more versatile because the configurations are handled as events rather than as files, which is more efficient.

1. Navigate to the desired device in **Devices** > **All devices** and open its **Configuration** tab.
2. Under **Device-supported configurations**, select the desired configuration type and click
   **Get snapshot from device** at the right.

Once retrieved, you can save or download the snapshot in the **Preview** section. The snapshot will be added to the **Configuration repository**, accessible from the **Management** menu in the navigator.

![Retrieve Configuration Snapshot](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-config-getnewsnapshot.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Clicking **Get snapshot from device** creates a new operation. If the operation is in status PENDING or EXECUTING, it is not possible to trigger another configuration request for the configuration type. Navigate to the **Control** tab of a device to cancel the operation or view the history of operation changes.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

To apply a configuration snapshot to a device which supports multiple configuration types:

1. Navigate to the desired device and open its **Configuration** tab.
2. Under **Device-supported configurations**, select the desired configuration type.
3. Under **Available supported configurations**, select a configuration file.
4. Click **Send configuration to device** at the right to apply the selected snapshot to the device.

![Apply new snapshot to a device](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-config-putsnapshot.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Under **Available supported configurations**, only configuration files with a matching configuration type property or without a configuration type defined are displayed. Also, configuration files are filtered based on the device type (ones that match the device type or have no device type specified).
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To retrieve and apply a configuration snapshot to a device which supports legacy file-based configuration

Devices managing configuration as files can do so in a basic form using legacy file-based configuration. Legacy file-based configuration only allows a single configuration to be set per a device.

![Retrieve Configuration Snapshot](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-config-old-getnewsnapshot.png)

#### To retrieve and apply a configuration snapshot to a device which supports text-based configuration

The most basic form of configuration is text-based configuration. A text command can be sent or received from a device. We recommend you to use text-based configuration for short human readable configuration files only.

![Send Text Configuration](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-config-text-getnewsnapshot.png)

<a name="credentials"></a>

#### To apply device profiles to multiple devices

Device profiles can be applied to multiple devices by using bulk operations.

1. Click **Device control** in the **Overview** menu to navigate to the **Device control** page. In the **Device control** page, a new bulk operation can be created to apply a device profile.
2. In the **Bulk operations** tab, click **New bulk operation** at the right of the top menu bar and in the resulting dialog select **Apply device profile**.
3. Follow the steps described in [Monitoring and controlling devices > Working with operations > To add a bulk operation](/users-guide/device-management/#bulk-operations) to schedule a bulk operation which applies a device profile.

The devices will install the firmware, software, and configurations items of the profile and report back the status of the operation. After applying the profile, the device objects in the platform are updated accordingly with the new profile information.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
When creating bulk operations, it is possible to use filters, and by this create bulk operations only for those devices where a profile has not been applied yet.

### Managing trusted certificates

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} allows devices to connect via MQTT protocol using a X.509 certificate for authentication. To do so, a certificate must be trusted by {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. A certificate is trusted when it is added to the trusted certificates and is in activated state.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This section describes how to manage trusted certificates. For information on connecting devices using certificates refer to [Device integration using MQTT > Device certificates](/device-integration/mqtt#device-certificates) in *Device integration*.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Click **Trusted certificates** in the **Management** menu in the navigator.

All certificates owned by the tenant will be displayed.

![Trusted certificates List](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-trusted-certificates-list.png)

The **Status** column indicates if the certificate is enabled or disabled. At any given time a tenant can have any number of enabled or disabled certificates.
Expand a certificate by clicking the arrow icon at the right to view more details.

The information in the table at the right side is extracted from the provided certificate. The content is read-only and cannot be changed.

#### To add a certificate

Before adding a new trusted certificate, make sure that:

* It s a X.509 certificate in PEM format.
* It is in version 3.
* It contains `BasicConstraints:[CA:true]`.
* It has not already been uploaded to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
* It is still valid (not expired).

To add a certificate perform these steps:

1. Click **Add trusted certificate** at the right of the top menu bar.
2. In the resulting dialog box, provide the following information:

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Certificate name  | User-provided name for the certificate. This name is not used by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and can serve as a description of the certificate.         |
| Certificate       | File containing the certificate in PEM format. Add the file by dropping it into this field or browsing for it in your file system.            |
| Auto registration | If selected, new devices which use a certificate signed by the authority owning this trusted certificate will automatically be registered. |
| Enabled/ Disabled | When disabled, devices which use a certificate signed by the authority owning this certificate, will not be able to connect.               |

3. Click **Add Certificate** to validate and save the certificate.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
For performance reasons, you shouldn't add the certificates of each device you want to connect, but only add the root certificate or one of the intermediate certificates from the chain which has been used to sign certificates used by devices.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To edit a trusted certificate

In the detail view of a certificate you may change the parameters on the left, that is, the certificate name, and the settings for the auto registration and enabled/disabled option.

For details on the fields, see the description on adding certificates above.

#### To delete a trusted certificate

To permanently delete a certificate from the trusted certificates list, click the menu icon at the right of the respective entry and in the context menu click **Delete**.
The certificate will be permanently deleted.

### Certificate Settings

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This section describes how to fine tune various certificate configurations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

* [Certificate Revocation List (CRL)](#crl-settings)

#### CRL Settings

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
In general, CRL(Certificate Revocation List) contains a list of serial numbers of revoked certificates. 
These are issued by certificate authorities (CAs) periodically and published through an endpoint called CDP (CRL Distribution Point).
Revocation reasons and dates are included in the CRL.

In {{< product-c8y-iot >}} terms, if there is a breach at device certificates signed by Trusted certificate, the users can let the platform know about the revoked certificates in 2 ways.
1.	**Online Revocation.**
	  Where the Trusted CA maintains the Certificate Revocation Lists with the list of certificate serial numbers that are breached and provide this information in the form of a CDP (CRL Distribution Point)
2.	**Offline Revocation**.
	  Where the trusted CA doesn't maintain the revocation details of the certificates, in which case, the platform users can manually upload the serial numbers of the revoked certificates.

Note that both online and offline CRL checks are by default **unchecked**.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

##### To enable online revocation

  1. Click on **CRL check** in right corner of the screen.
  2. Enable **Online** option.

![CRl Details](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-crl-option-check.png)

##### To enable offline revocation
  1. Click on **CRL check** in right corner of the screen.
  2. Check **Offline** 
  3. To add revoked certificate serial numbers manually, enter the serial number and date in **Revoked certificates list** panel.
     
  	 Use `+` button to add new entries in below format
     | Field             | Description                                                |
     |:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
     | Serial Number  | Needs to be in `Hex Value`|
     | Date (Optional)       | Date format: `dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss`. Revocation date cannot be a future date. If the date field is empty, current date is considered|
  4. Click save to confirm your entries.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}

Certificate revocation is an irreversible process.
