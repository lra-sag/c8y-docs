Microservices are server-side applications which may be used to extend the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform with customer-specific functionality.

If you want to jump right in, check out our Hello world tutorial for [Java](/microservice-sdk/java#java-microservice).

Would you rather code in Python or JavaScript?
We do not have an SDK for these, but you can check out our examples for developing microservices in [Python](/microservice-sdk/http/#python-microservice) and [Node.js](/microservice-sdk/http/#node-js-microservice).

For detailed information, see:

* [General aspects](/microservice-sdk/general-aspects) and functionality of using microservices on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}
* How to develop and deploy microservices using the SDK for [Java](/microservice-sdk/java)
* How to use the [Cumulocity's REST interface](/microservice-sdk/rest) to develop microservices
