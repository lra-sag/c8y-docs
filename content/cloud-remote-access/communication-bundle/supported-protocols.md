### Supported protocols {#supported-protocols}

Cloud Remote Access supports the following protocols:

* Remote Desktop (VNC)
	* Shares the desktop of the remote device
	* Mouse and keyboard for interaction
* Secure Shell (SSH)
	* Console for command line access
	* Keyboard for interaction
* Terminal (Telnet)
	* Protocol used for old device types
	* Console for command line access
	* Keyboard for interaction

Telnet is considered to be an insecure protocol lacking built-in security measures. For network communication in a production environment we highly recommend you to use the SSH protocol instead.
