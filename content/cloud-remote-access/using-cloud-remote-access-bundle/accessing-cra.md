In the Device management application in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, click **All devices** in the **Devices** menu and select the desired gateway from the device list.

When you open the gateway you will find the **Remote access** tab in its tab list.

In the **Remote Access** tab, you can configure devices for remote control, so-called "endpoints", and connect to remote devices.

Connections can be established to the gateway itself (localhost) or to any device in the local area network reachable by the device.

If you do not see the **Remote access** tab in the details of your gateway but all prerequisites are met, or if you are a gateway manufacturer and would like to support Cloud Remote Access on your gateway please contact [product support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/).
