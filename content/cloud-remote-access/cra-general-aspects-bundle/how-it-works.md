Cloud Remote Access is a technique to tunnel protocol traffic (such as VNC, Telnet and SSH) to the cloud without opening any ports at the gateway. Thus Cloud Remote Access is a secure way to directly access low level protocols on devices through the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform UI in a web browser.

The following protocols are supported:

* Remote Desktop (VNC)
* Secure Shell (SSH)
* Terminal (Telnet)

See [Supported protocols and gateways](/cloud-remote-access/communication/#supported-protocols) for details.

Cloud Remote Access works as in the illustration below. The remotely controlled device runs a VNC, SSH or Telnet server and is connected to a gateway compatible with Cloud Remote Access. This gateway must be registered as a device within the Device management application in {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. More information about registering devices and instructions can be found in [Registering devices](/device-management-application/registering-devices).

With Cloud Remote Access users can

* view status visualizations and track updates of remote devices directly in the same way as if you were at the device location.
* connect to remote devices easily as complex VPN setups are not required.
* establish a connection via Telnet or SSH to the gateway itself or to any device in the local area network.

The connection to remote devices is securely encrypted through TLS technology. Additionally, passwords are encrypted in your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account, so that you do not need to manage them elsewhere.
