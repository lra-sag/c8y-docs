{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides extensive device management for fully certified devices. This includes:

* Hardware and modem information.
* Connection monitoring.
* Centralized fault management and service level monitoring.
* Configuration management.
* Software and firmware management.
* Graphs of device statistics.
* Frequently used remote controls (such as restart button and switches).
* Troubleshooting features such as events list and operations queue.

The level of depth in device management may depend on device features (for example if a device does not support remote firmware upgrade, it will also not be available through {{< product-c8y-iot >}}). For interfacing devices not yet certified with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, the [fragment library](/device-integration/fragment-library/) and [Device integration](/device-integration/introduction) are publicly available.
