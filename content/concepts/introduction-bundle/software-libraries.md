{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers a wide range of functionality for interfacing IoT devices and other IoT-related data sources with the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform.

If your device uses a completely proprietary runtime environment, you can always use [MQTT](/device-integration/mqtt) and [SmartREST 2](/smartrest/smartrest-two/). These will work on practically any internet-connected device today, down to the smallest systems.

Detailed information on device integration using [MQTT](/device-integration/mqtt/) and [REST](/device-integration/rest) can be found in [Device integration](/device-integration/introduction/).
