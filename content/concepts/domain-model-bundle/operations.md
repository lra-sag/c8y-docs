Devices can be remote-controlled and managed in {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Examples:

-   Device control: Setting a switch which controls temperature.
-   Device configuration: Setting up a charge table in a smart meter.
-   Device maintenance: Requesting a gateway to download and install a new firmware.

In {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, these use cases are implemented by sending *operations* to a device.

The following snippet shows an operation for setting the state of the relay with the ID "42" to "OPEN":

```json
{
    "deviceId": "42",
    "c8y_Relay": {
        "state": "OPEN"
    }
}
```

Just like other types of data, operations are also standardized through the sensor library to simplify application development (see below). For example, setting a switch should be the same for all switches regardless of their make.

Operations are modeled just like fragments in the inventory model (see above). The same extensibility concept applies. Random vendor-proprietary extensions to the standard operations are possible. These are not denied or modified by {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

### Sending operations to devices {#sending-operations-to-devices}

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} delivers operations to devices over any network using a reliable queueing routine. This queueing routine respects the limitations and security requirements of IoT networks:

-   Devices are often connected over unreliable, low-bandwidth links that may only occasionally be available. Devices may, for example, only dial up once in a day to the network to fetch commands for execution. Therefore {{< product-c8y-iot >}} communicates asynchronously with devices.

-   Device protocols are often not designed for secure online communication. They may not pass NAT networks, firewalls and web proxies. They may not be secure enough for public exposure on the Internet. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers the possibility to connect these devices as HTTPS clients.

-   It may not even be possible to reach a mobile device over the internet. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} uses push technology to send operations to devices.

To pass an operation from an application to a device, a process of several steps is required as illustrated in the image below. Assume that the user issues a remote control operation for a device (such as a device restart) from an application. The application creates the operation in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} (Step "1"). {{< product-c8y-iot >}} will queue the operation for execution and return control back to the application immediately.

At some point in time, the agent responsible for the device will request operations that are queued for the devices that it manages ("Step 2"). This will happen immediately through {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s push mechanism or at a regular or scheduled interval.

The agent will execute the operations on the devices that it manages (Step "3"), and will update {{< product-c8y-iot >}} with the results of the execution (Step "4"). The devices that the agent manages are direct or indirect children ("childDevices") of the agent.

Finally, the application can query the results of the operation (Step "5"). Audit records are generated both for the original request to run the device control operation and for the acknowledgement that the operation was actually run.

If there are communication issues while delivering an operation to a device, an alarm should be raised by the agent.

Sometimes there are delays between sending an operation to a device and retrieving a response. The system assumes a delivery unless an error is reported to maintain functionality.

### Designing operations for reliability {#designing-operations-for-reliability}

Operations should always be idempotent. Idempotent means that no matter how often you run the operation, the outcome is always the same.

For example, an operation to set a switch to a certain state is idempotent. No matter how often the switch is set to "on", it will be "on" afterwards. An operation to toggle a switch is not idempotent - the result depends on whether the operation was run an odd or an even number of times.
