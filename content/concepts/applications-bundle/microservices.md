Microservices are server-side applications. Microservices can be used to develop for example the following functionality on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}:

* Integrations
* Batch analytics
* Decoder
* Backend applications

Microservices are deployed as Docker images to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, and follow specific conventions. They typically provide one REST API, which is available under /service/&lt;microservice-name&gt;. They typically access {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using the documented REST API.

When developing a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} microservice, a developer is not restricted to any programming language. However, a microservice must serve as a HTTP server working on port 80 and must be encapsulated in a Docker image.

The hosting of the microservice is provided by {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. This way developers can focus on business logic and leave scaling, security, high availability and monitoring to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. Microservices can be built on top of the API exposed by the {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. This way, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} microservices are a comfortable means to provide new functionality and extend existing ones.

For detailed information on developing and deploying microservices on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} refer to [Microservice SDK](/microservice-sdk/microservice-sdk-introduction/) which provides information on the general concept of microservices in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} as well as specific guidance and examples for various programming languages. For microservice developers {{< company-c8y >}} provides a Microservice SDK in the [Java programming language](/microservice-sdk/java).
