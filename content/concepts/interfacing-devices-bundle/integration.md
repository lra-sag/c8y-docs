### System integration {#system-integration}

Enterprises offering IoT-enabled services typically run other IT systems that supply important information on IoT assets and devices. Examples of those systems are:

-   Asset management systems that provide additional information about the available devices and their location.
-   Customer relationship management systems that provide information about the customer as device owner.
-   Workforce management systems that provide information on the maintenance status of devices.

Technically, developing and running an agent for system integration is not different from an agent for device integration. However, the subset of data owned by the systems is different. Agents for device integration own the device hierarchy and device configuration information. Agents for system integration provide additional information for devices and own parts of the asset hierarchy. Together, they contribute to the device information stored in the inventory to provide a centralized view on everything related to the assets and devices that are relevant for the IoT service.
