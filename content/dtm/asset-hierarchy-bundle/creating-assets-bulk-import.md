To import the entire asset hierarchy with all assets at once, use the bulk import feature.
For each [asset model](/dtm/asset-types/#asset-models), a CSV template is provided.
Fill in the required details in this template and upload the file to create the assets in bulk for the selected asset model.

### To use the bulk import feature {#to-use-the-bulk-import-feature}

To use the Bulk import feature, you must enable the **Digital Twin** permission for the user's role, following these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Administration application](/standard-tenant/) via the application switcher in the top right corner.

2. Under **Quick links** click **Roles**.

3. In the **Global roles** tab, select the role to which permissions are to be provided.

4. Select the "Admin" permission for "Digital Twin" in the "Permissions" section.

5. Enable access to the DTM application by selecting the following checkboxes:

	* Under **Application access**, select "Dtm-ms".

	* Under **Custom applications**, select "Digital twin Manager".

5. Click **Save**.

Once the permissions are assigned, the bulk import feature can be used.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
If the permissions are not assigned, the CSV template will not be downloaded correctly.

To initiate a bulk import from the **Assets** page, you must either have CREATE or ADMIN permission for the permission type "Inventory".

By default, you have full access to assets created by you regardless of permissions granted. To perform a partial import on an asset created by other users, you will need READ and ADMIN permissions for permission type "Inventory" or alternatively, READ and CHANGE permissions for "Inventory" in the inventory roles for the specific asset.

### To download a CSV template for bulk import {#to-download-a-csv-template-for-bulk-import}

Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Assets** page and click **Import assets**.

2. The **Import assets** dialog has a dropdown **Select asset model**. If you have added the asset models, all the root asset models are listed in the dropdown.

3. Select the asset model for which you want to create the asset hierarchy.

4. On selection, the following options become available:

	* **Drop CSV file here or click to browse** - upload the CSV template as a file, for importing assets in bulk.
	* **Download Template** - download the CSV template for the selected asset model.

5. Click **Download Template** to download the CSV template.

### CSV template parameters {#csv-template-parameters}

The CSV template has the following fields:

<table>
<col width="20">
<col width="50">
<col width="30">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Field</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Mandatory / Optional</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><b>AssetModel / DeviceType </b></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Enter the key of the asset model.</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Mandatory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><b>AssetName</b></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Provide the name of the asset you want to create.</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Mandatory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><b>Path</b></td>
<td style="text-align:left">
Path denotes the location of the asset within the asset hierarchy.<br>
For a root asset, it remains blank. For a subasset, provide a path up to the root asset.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
For an asset called "SE-T101-Blade 1" in the hierarchy "Wind turbine > Rotor > Blade" the path value is "SE-Turbine-101/SE-T101-Rotor", where "SE-Turbine-101" and "SE-T101-Rotor" each represent the respective asset models.<br><br>
In case of partial import, the path is defined in relation to the asset from which the file is imported. For the immediate children of the asset, the path remains blank.<br/><br/>
<b>Example:</b><br/>
In the hierarchy, "Wind turbine > Rotor > Blade", to import a new Rotor, "SE-T102-Rotor," and a Blade, "SE-T101-Blade2," under the existing Turbine "SE-Turbine-101", the path value for the Rotor remains blank, and the path value for the Blade is "SE-T102-Rotor."

<td style="text-align:left"><b>Device ID / External ID</b></td>
<td style="text-align:left">If the asset being created has a device associated with it, then provide the Device ID of the device here.<br><br>
Note that you can use a list of semi-colon separated Device IDs or External IDs to associate multiple devices to the asset.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Mandatory (If the property is set as required in the asset model. For details, see <a href="/dtm/asset-types/#to-add-an-asset-property-to-an-asset-model">To add an asset property to an asset model</a>).</td>

</table>

![bulk-import-template](/images/dtm/bulk-import/dtm-bulk-import-template.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
Use only comma (,) as a separator when entering values in the CSV template.

Modify the excel settings to provide the date in a YYYY-MM-DD format. This prevents auto-correction of the date on input.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

To provide a file input as an asset property value, the file must first be uploaded to a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} API.

Refer to the [Binaries API](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/#operation/postBinariesCollectionResource) in the {{< openapi >}} for details on how to upload a file to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

The binary ID in the API response must be provided as input for the asset property field with type "file" in the CSV template.
{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
During the bulk import, the file size validation is skipped as the file is already uploaded to the tenant.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

If the type is "Boolean", the input field must be either "true" or "false".
If the type is "enumeration", then the input field must be in the list of values specified during creation of the asset property.
If the type is "text" or "number" and custom criteria were provided during asset property creation, then the input value in CSV template must fulfill all the asset property criteria.

When creating a property, you have the option to assign a default value. If a property's value is left empty in the CSV file during the bulk import, its value is set to default. To override this behavior, enter 'null' as the value in the CSV file. This does not set the value and it is seen as undefined when viewing the asset.

Fill in details for all the assets which must be created as part of the asset hierarchy.

Start with the asset details for root asset model.
Then enter the asset details for child a models under the root asset.
Next, enter the details for the next level in the hierarchy of subassets and repeat until the details for all the assets are entered in the CSV template.
Save the CSV template in your system.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
It is recommended to import a maximum of 5000 assets at a time for a better user experience.

### To upload a CSV template {#to-upload-a-csv-template}

To upload the CSV template follow the steps below:

1. Click **Import assets** in the **Assets** page.

2. Select the asset model in the **Import assets** dialog.

3. Upload the previously filled and saved CSV template in the **Drop file here** section and click **Import**.

4. If all the inputs are provided correctly, the bulk import is successful, resulting in a success notification. The asset hierarchy and its assets are created successfully.

5. View the newly created assets in the **Assets** page.

If the inputs are not provided in the correct format, the bulk import fails with validation errors, resulting in a **Failed asset imports** notification, showing the issue types, for example, an invalid template or an incorrect asset hierarchy.
No assets are created.

![bulk-import-failed-import](/images/dtm/bulk-import/dtm-bulk-import-failed-asset-imports.png)

If the bulk import fails, review the reported issues and try again.

### Partial import {#partial-import}

If the asset hierarchy already exists, and you want to import more assets, it can be achieved by a partial import.

To import subassets or the subasset hierarchy:

1. Navigate to the **Asset tree** page of the subasset and download the template using **Import assets**.

2. Fill in the details for the subasset hierarchy in the CSV template. See [CSV template parameters](#csv-template-parameters) for more details.

	{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
From any hierarchy level, the template will be downloaded only for its child hierarchy.
Assets must only be imported for the child hierarchy.
	{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

4. Click **Import assets**.

5. Upload the CSV template in the **Drop file here** section in the **Import assets** dialog and click **Import**.

If all details are mentioned correctly in the CSV template, the subasset hierarchy is created successfully.

An unsuccessful partial import will result in a **Failed asset imports** notification, showing the validation issues.
Review the reported issues and try again.
