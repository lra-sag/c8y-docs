The two-factor authentication (TFA) is an extra layer of security that only completes authentication with a combination of two different factors: something the users know (username and password) and something they have (for example, smartphone) or something they are (for example, fingerprint).

There are two possible TFA strategies: Short Message Service (SMS) and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). Only one of them can be active at a time.

To check whether TFA is enabled for a certain user, go to the **Users** page and see the TFA status column right from the password strength column. A key icon indicates that TFA is enabled and by hovering over it you can see the strategy that is being used.
