For details see [Platform administration > {{< enterprise-tenant >}} administration > Customizing your platform](/enterprise-tenant/customization).


### Tenant hierarchy {#tenant-hierarchy}

The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant concept builds a 3-level hierarchy, including the following levels from bottom to top:

* [{{< standard-tenant >}}](/glossary/s/#standard-tenant)
* [{{< enterprise-tenant >}}](/glossary/e/#enterprise-tenant)
* [{{< management-tenant >}}](/glossary/m/#management-tenant)

These three levels differ in their scope, particularly with regards to administration.
