### Enterprise tenant {#enterprise-tenant}

A tenant type in the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant hierarchy](/glossary/t/#tenant-hierarchy).

{{< enterprise-tenant >}}s offer additional administrative functionality compared to a {{< standard-tenant >}}, the major difference being multi-tenancy. Using an {{< enterprise-tenant >}}, you can create and manage subtenants, manage the subscribed applications/features of the subtenants, and invoice subtenants based on usage statistics. Moreover, {{< enterprise-tenant >}}s offer individual customization features, such as Branding for the creation of an individual look & feel.

See also [{{< standard-tenant >}}](/glossary/s/#standard-tenant) and [{{< management-tenant >}}](/glossary/m/#management-tenant).


### Event Processing Language (EPL) {#epl}

On top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} you can use the Apama streaming analytics engine to define business operations for real-time processing. The operation logic is implemented in Apamaâ€™s Event Processing Language (EPL).
EPL covers statements, which are organized into actions and monitors. Monitor files can be edited directly from within {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Streaming Analytics](/glossary/c/#streaming-analytics) application. Alternatively, you can install Apama on your local machine and develop your applications in an Eclipse-based development environment. You can deploy your monitor files as Apama applications to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

For details see [Getting started > Technical concepts > Real-time processing > Using the Apama Event Processing Language (EPL)](/concepts/realtime/#using-epl).


### EPL Apps {#epl-apps}

EPL Apps is part of the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Streaming Analytics](/glossary/c/#streaming-analytics) application. It allows you to develop EPL apps (that is, single \*.mon files) directly within {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, written in Apama EPL. You can also import existing \*.mon files as EPL apps into {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. When you activate an EPL app from the Streaming Analytics application, you deploy it to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

See also [Event Processing Language (EPL)](/glossary/e/#epl) and [Analytics Builder](/glossary/a/#analytics-builder).
