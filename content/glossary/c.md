### {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Streaming Analytics {#streaming-analytics}

Using the Streaming Analytics application, you can add your own logic to your IoT solution for immediate processing of incoming data from devices or other data sources. These user-defined operations can, for example, alert applications of new incoming data, create new operations based on the received data (such as sending an alarm when a threshold for a sensor is exceeded), or trigger operations on devices. The operation logic is based on [Apama’s Event Processing Language (EPL)](/glossary/e/#epl).
