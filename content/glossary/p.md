### Permissions {#permissions}

The ability to execute certain functionality in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform is based on permissions. Permissions define explicitly what functionality can be executed by a user. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} distinguishes read permissions and administration permissions. Read permissions enable users to read data. Administration permissions enable users to create, update and delete data.

To manage permissions more easily, they are grouped into roles. Every user can be associated with a number of roles, adding up permissions of the user.
