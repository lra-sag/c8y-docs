A tenant policy is a set of tenant options and retention rules. Tenant options and retention rules may be specified during tenant creation.

Creating a tenant policy with a specific set of options and rules saves time when creating multiple tenants with the same settings.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The options and rules are copied into the tenant. Editing the policy has no effect on tenants that have already been created.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
Tenant options specified in a tenant policy are **not encrypted**. You should not specify or overwrite tenant options here with a "credentials." prefix, since the platform expects those options to be encrypted with data that will appear after the tenant has been created.

When defining the retention rules and options you can select a checkbox to allow subtenants to modify definitions of these rules or options. By default, this checkbox is not activated. Be aware that if you do not select this checkbox after creating the subtenant you must run an update from the {{< management-tenant >}} in order to edit those rules and options.
