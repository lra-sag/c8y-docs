title: Hello MQTT Java with certificates
layout: redirect
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Java MQTT client with {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using X.509 certificates for authentication.

In the GitHub repository [cumulocity-examples](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/mqtt-client), you can find a sample Java MQTT client using X.509 certificates and all necessary scripts used in this tutorial.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

In order to follow this tutorial, check the following prerequisites:

*   You have correctly configured the Java client based on the [Hello MQTT Java](#hello-mqtt-java) tutorial.
*   You have a valid tenant, a user and a password in order to access {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
*   You have a valid certificate. If you don't have it, follow the instructions in the next section to generate one.

#### To generate a valid certificate {#to-generate-a-valid-certificate}

If you don't have a valid certificate, you can generate one for testing purposes, following the instructions below.

1.  Download the scripts from the [cumulocity-examples](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/mqtt-client/scripts) repository.
2.  Create a root self-signed certificate (execute the script *00createRootSelfSignedCertificate.sh*) and upload it to your tenant. You can do it via [the Device management application in the UI](/device-management-application/managing-device-data/#managing-trusted-certificates) or via [REST](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/#tag/Tenant-API).
3.  Create and sign the certificate (execute the script *01createSignedCertificate.sh*).
4.  Move the certificates to keystore (execute the script *02moveCertificatesToKeystore.sh*).
5.  Finally, import the trusted certificate into keystore running the following command:

```shell
$ keytool -importcert -file c8y-mqtt-server.cer -keystore chain-with-private-key-iot-device-0001.jks -alias "Alias"
```

### Developing the "Hello, MQTT world!" client with certificates {#developing-the-hello-mqtt-world-client-with-certificates}

To develop a "Hello, world!" MQTT client for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} with certificates, you must

*  copy the certificate and upload it to the platform,
*  change the configuration in the MQTT client.

#### To copy and upload the certificate {#to-copy-and-upload-the-certificate}

Copy the certificate from the file *chain-iot-device-0001.pem* and upload it to the platform employing a POST request:

**Endpoint:**  <kbd>/tenant/tenants/{tenantId}/trusted-certificates</kbd> <br/>
**Authorization:** Basic <br/>
**Content-Type:** application/json <br/>
**Request body:**

```json
{
    "status" :  "ENABLED",
    "name" : "sampleName",
    "autoRegistrationEnabled" : "true",
    "certInPemFormat" : "<<certificate in pem format>>"
}
```

### To change the configuration {#to-change-the-configuration}

To change the configuration in the MQTT client, copy the file *chain-with-private-key-iot-device-0001.jks* into the resource folder and set the configuration. Note that the script employed (Step 4.) uses the password `changeit`. If you changed the value in the script, also do it for `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD` in the following example.

```java
// Configuration
private static final String KEYSTORE_NAME = "chain-with-private-key-iot-device-0001.jks";
private static final String KEYSTORE_PASSWORD = "changeit";
private static final String KEYSTORE_FORMAT = "jks";

private static final String TRUSTSTORE_NAME = "chain-with-private-key-iot-device-0001.jks";
private static final String TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD = "changeit";
private static final String TRUSTSTORE_FORMAT = "jks";

private static final String CLIENT_ID = "iotdevice0001";
private static final String BROKER_URL = "<SSL URL of the platform>";

private MqttClient connect() throws MqttException {
    MqttClient mqttClient = new MqttClient(BROKER_URL, "d:" + CLIENT_ID, new MemoryPersistence());
    MqttConnectOptions options = new MqttConnectOptions();

    options.setCleanSession(true);

    Properties sslProperties = new Properties();
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.KEYSTORE, getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(KEYSTORE_NAME).getPath());
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.KEYSTOREPWD, KEYSTORE_PASSWORD);
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.KEYSTORETYPE, KEYSTORE_FORMAT);
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.TRUSTSTORE, getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(TRUSTSTORE_NAME).getPath());
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.TRUSTSTOREPWD, TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD);
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.TRUSTSTORETYPE, TRUSTSTORE_FORMAT);
    sslProperties.put(SSLSocketFactoryFactory.CLIENTAUTH, true);

    options.setSSLProperties(sslProperties);
    mqttClient.setCallback(this);
    System.out.println("Connecting to the broker at " + BROKER_URL);
    mqttClient.connect(options);

    return mqttClient;
}
```  

The device can now publish and subscribe as a standard device. Note that before the first connect no other actions are required, for example, creating a user. The user is created during the [auto registration](/device-integration/mqtt/#device-certificates) process.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
You do not need to set a password, user or tenant for the MQTT client connecting using certificates. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} will recognize the tenant and the user by the provided certificate.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}
