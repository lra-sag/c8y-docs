The MQTT implementation of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides the following benefits:

* Multi-tenancy support: A single endpoint serves multiple tenants.
* Device identity management: Devices authenticate using device-specific credentials.
* Device registration: Non-personalized devices can be deployed by pairing them with {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenants.
* Device management: Rich, pre-defined device management payload formats to enable out-of-the-box management of millions of devices.
* Standard IoT payload formats: Pre-defined payload formats to support IoT sensor readings, alarm management, remote control and device hierarchies.
* Custom payload formats: Additional payload formats can be added.
* Minimum traffic overhead.
* Processing modes: Control whether data is persisted in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} database, transiently passed to real-time processing, processed using quiescent mode which ensures that real-time notifications are disabled or is processed using CEP mode that ensures data is transiently sent to real-time processing engine only with real-time notifications disabled.
* Full bi-directional communication.
* MQTT over WebSockets support.
* TLS support.
* Full horizontal scalability.
