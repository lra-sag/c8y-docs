The **Device profile** tab shows the different parameters of the added device profiles. From a device agent perspective, device profiles are a combination of firmware update, software update, and typed file-based device configuration. Large parts of the agent code to support these capabilities can be reused.

Device profile functionality is enabled when the device announces the ```c8y_DeviceProfile``` operation in its ```c8y_SupportedOperations```. The **Device profile** tab allows users to apply a profile to a device. This creates a ```c8y_DeviceProfile``` operation according to the configured profile. If present the firmware, software, and configuration should be handled exactly like their individual operations (```c8y_Firmware```, ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate```, and typed ```c8y_DownloadConfigFile```). We recommend you to execute a ```c8y_Profile``` operation by installing firmware first, software second and configuration third to minimize the potential of later actions overriding earlier ones.

When a device receives a ```c8y_Profile``` operation it should announce the target profile in its own managed object first.

```http
PUT /inventory/managedObjects/<deviceId>
```
```json
{
   "c8y_Profile": {
       "profileName": "my profile",
       "profileId": "158751",
       "profileExecuted": false
   }
}
```

|Name|Type|Mandatory|Description|
|----|----|----|----|
|profileName|string|Yes|Name of the device profile|
|profileId|string|Yes|The ID reference of the device profile object|
|profileExecuted|Boolean|Yes|Indicator showing if the profile has been applied fully. Must be false in this context|

After completing each of the three subsections the device must announce its current state in its own managed object the same way as described in the individual operations using the fragments ```c8y_Firmware```, ```c8y_SoftwareList```, and ```c8y_Configuration_<type>``` respectively. Then the device should update its installed profile state in its managed object by updating the *profileExecuted* property to true.

```http
PUT /inventory/managedObjects/<deviceId>
```
```json
{
   "c8y_Profile": {
       "profileName": "my profile",
       "profileId": "158751",
       "profileExecuted": true
   }
}
```

|Name|Type|Mandatory|Description|
|----|----|----|----|
|profileName|string|Yes|Name of the device profile|
|profileId|string|Yes|The ID reference of the device profile object|
|profileExecuted|Boolean|Yes|Indicator showing if the profile has been applied fully; must be true in this context|

The device is expected to perform the following actions:

1. Set operation status to EXECUTING
2. Set the ```c8y_Profile``` fragment in the deviceâ€™s own managed object with profileExecuted = false
3. Install firmware if included and complete installation by updating the ```c8y_Firmware``` fragment in its own managed object
4. Install software if included and complete installation by updating the ```c8y_SoftwareList``` fragment in its own managed object
5. Install configuration if included and complete installation by updating the ```c8y_Configuration_<type>``` fragment for each configuration in its own managed object
6. Set the ```c8y_Profile``` fragment in the device's own managed object with profileExecuted = true
7. Set the operation status to SUCCESSFUL


**SmartREST example**

In addition to the static templates for firmware, software, and configuration provided by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} there are specific templates available for handling device profiles. The 527 static response template is designed to receive the operation. The 121 static template can be used to set the current state of device profile:

1. Receive ```c8y_DeviceProfile``` operation <br>
  ```
  527,DeviceSerial,$FW,device_fw,1.0.1,https://cumulocity.com/fw,false,,$SW,curl,2.3.4,http://my.url.com,install,cumulocity_agent,1.2.3,https://cumulocity.com/agent,install,$CONF,http://cumulocity.com/conf,ssh_conf,https://demos.cumulocity.com/inventory/binaries/156719,agent_conf
  ```
2. Set operation status to EXECUTING <br>
  `501,c8y_DeviceProfile`
3. Set target profile <br>
  `121,false,`
4. Download, install and confirm firmware installation state <br>
  `115,device_fw,1.0.1,https://cumulocity.com/fw`
5. Download, install and confirm software installation state <br>
  `116,curl,2.3.4,http://my.url.com,cumulocity_agent,1.2.3,https://cumulocity.com/agent`
6. Download, install and confirm configuration installation state for each configuration <br>
  `120,ssh_conf,http://cumulocity.com/conf,config,` <br>
  `120,agent_conf,https://demos.cumulocity.com/inventory/binaries/156719,agent.cfg,` <br>
7. Set the target profile as executed<br>
  `121,true,`
8. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL <br>
  `503,c8y_DeviceProfile`
