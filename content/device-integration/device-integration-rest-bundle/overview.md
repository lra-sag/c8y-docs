REST is a very simple and secure protocol based on HTTP(S) and TCP. It is today the de-facto Internet standard supported by all networked programming environments ranging from very simple devices up to large-scale IT. One of the many books introducing REST is [RESTful Web Services](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260).

This section explains how to use {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s REST interfaces to integrate devices with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. For general information on using REST interfaces and for information on developing applications on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using REST refer to [Microservice SDK](/microservice-sdk/rest/#overview).

The description is closely linked to the {{< openapi >}}, which describes each interface in detail, as well as the fragment library:

- [REST implementation](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/#section/REST-implementation) is the reference for all general concepts.
- [Fragment library](/device-integration/fragment-library/) specifies managed objects (devices) as well as for predefined sensor and control capabilities of devices.

If you develop using Java ME/SE, JavaScript or C/C++, check the relevant chapters in this guide for even more convenient access to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s functionality. Also, if you use any of the supported development boards, see the corresponding description in the Devices guide for more information.
