**Version:** 1017.0.23 | **Packages:** @c8y/cli, @c8y/apps and @c8y/ngx-components

It is a common use case that you want to show additional information to a user in a details view, for example, for a device or a group.

This how-to recipe explains how to create a new tab in the device details view:

![Device info with custom tab](/images/web-sdk/device-detail-custom-tab.png)

In Web SDK for Angular, this kind of view is called `ViewContext` as it provides a view for a certain context.
There are a couple of context views, for example, `Device`, `Group`, `User`, `Application` and `Tenant`.
You can access them by navigating to a certain `Route` with the hash navigation.
For example, if you go to the route *apps/cockpit/#/device/1234*, the application tries to resolve the device with the ID `1234`.

The details view usually shows a couple of `Tabs`, like the **Info** tab in the screenshot above.
It is referenced by another route called */info* but reuses the context of the device to show information about it.

In the following, we will guide you through the process of creating a new tab for this view that is accessible through the route *apps/cockpit/#/device/:id/hello*.

### 1. Initialize the example application {#1-initialize-the-example-application}

As a starting point, you need an application supporting context routes.
For this purpose, create a new Cockpit application using the `c8ycli`:

```js
c8ycli new my-cockpit cockpit -a @c8y/apps@1017.0.23
```

Next, you must install all dependencies. Switch to the new folder and run `npm install`.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The `c8ycli new` command has a `-a` flag which defines which package to use for scaffolding. This way you can also define which version of the application you want to scaffold, for example:
`c8ycli new my-cockpit cockpit -a @c8y/apps@1017.0.23` will scaffold an application with the version `10.17.0.23`
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### 2. Add a new HOOK_ROUTE {#2-add-a-new-hookroute}

The hook concept allows you to hook into the existing code.
In this example we want to add a so-called `ChildRoute` (by Angular) on the existing route *device/:id*.

To achieve this, add the following code to the *app.module.ts*:

```js
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { RouterModule as NgRouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { UpgradeModule as NgUpgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
// ---- 8< changed part ----
import { CoreModule, RouterModule, HOOK_ROUTE, ViewContext } from '@c8y/ngx-components';
// ---- >8 ----
import { DashboardUpgradeModule, UpgradeModule, HybridAppModule, UPGRADE_ROUTES } from '@c8y/ngx-components/upgrade';
import { CockpitDashboardModule, ReportDashboardModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/context-dashboard';
import { ReportsModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/reports';
import { SensorPhoneModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/sensor-phone';
import { BinaryFileDownloadModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/binary-file-download';
import { AssetsNavigatorModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/assets-navigator';


@NgModule({
    imports: [
        // Upgrade module must be the first
        UpgradeModule,
        BrowserAnimationsModule,
        RouterModule.forRoot(),
        NgRouterModule.forRoot([...UPGRADE_ROUTES], { enableTracing: false, useHash: true }),
        CoreModule.forRoot(),
        AssetsNavigatorModule,
        ReportsModule,
        NgUpgradeModule,
        DashboardUpgradeModule,
        CockpitDashboardModule,
        SensorPhoneModule,
        ReportDashboardModule,
        BinaryFileDownloadModule
    ],

    // ---- 8< added part ----
    providers: [{
        provide: HOOK_ROUTE,                 // 1.
        useValue: [{                         // 2.
            context: ViewContext.Device,     // 3.
            path: 'hello',                   // 4.
            component: HelloComponent,       // 5.
            label: 'hello',                  // 6.
            priority: 100,
            icon: 'rocket'
        }],
        multi: true
    }]
    // ---- >8 ----

})
export class AppModule extends HybridAppModule {
    constructor(protected upgrade: NgUpgradeModule) {
        super();
    }
}
```

Explanation of the numbers above:

 1. Provides the multi-provider hook `HOOK_ROUTE`. This tells the application to extend the current route configuration.
 2. Specifies that we want to use a value to define the route hook. You can also use a class here, for example, if you want to resolve the routes asynchronously.
 3. Defines the context of the route. Use the `ViewContext` enum to define it. For this example you want to extend the context of a device.
 4. The path where it is going to be shown. It is added to the context path. For this example the complete path is: *device/:id/hello*.
 5. Defines which component should be shown if the path is hit by a user.
 6. The properties `label` and `icon` define what the tab should look like. The `priority` defines in which position it should be shown.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The `HOOK_ROUTE` inherits the Angular `Route` type. All of its properties can be reused here.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

After this alignment the route is registered but the application will fail to compile as the `HelloComponent` does not exist yet.
You will create it in the next section.

### 3. Add a component to display context data {#3-add-a-component-to-display-context-data}

The `HelloComponent` might want to display details about the device.
To do this, it needs information about the context it has been opened in.
The context route resolves the device upfront.
You can directly access it via the parent route.

Create a new file called *hello.component.ts*:

```js
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: `
  <c8y-title>world</c8y-title>
  <pre>
    <code>
      {{route.snapshot.parent.data.contextData | json}}
    </code>
  </pre>
  `
})
export class HelloComponent {
  constructor(public route: ActivatedRoute) {}
}
```

This component injects the `ActivatedRoute` and accesses its parent data.
This is the key point: as the parent context route already has resolved the data of the device, this component will always show the detailed data of the current device.

Adding it to the `entryComponents` in *app.module.ts* will allow you to compile the application:

```js
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { RouterModule as NgRouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { UpgradeModule as NgUpgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
import { CoreModule, RouterModule, HOOK_ROUTE, ViewContext } from '@c8y/ngx-components';
import { DashboardUpgradeModule, UpgradeModule, HybridAppModule, UPGRADE_ROUTES } from '@c8y/ngx-components/upgrade';
import { CockpitDashboardModule, ReportDashboardModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/context-dashboard';
import { ReportsModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/reports';
import { SensorPhoneModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/sensor-phone';
import { BinaryFileDownloadModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/binary-file-download';
import { AssetsNavigatorModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/assets-navigator';
// ---- 8< added part ----
import { HelloComponent } from './hello.component';
// ---- >8 ----

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // Upgrade module must be the first
    UpgradeModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(),
    NgRouterModule.forRoot([...UPGRADE_ROUTES], { enableTracing: false, useHash: true }),
    CoreModule.forRoot(),
    AssetsNavigatorModule,
    ReportsModule,
    NgUpgradeModule,
    DashboardUpgradeModule,
    CockpitDashboardModule,
    SensorPhoneModule,
    ReportDashboardModule,
    BinaryFileDownloadModule
  ],

  // ---- 8< added part ----
  declarations: [HelloComponent],
  entryComponents: [HelloComponent],
  // ---- >8 ----

  providers: [{
    provide: HOOK_ROUTE,
    useValue: [{
      context: ViewContext.Device,
      path: 'hello',
      component: HelloComponent,
      label: 'hello',
      priority: 100,
      icon: 'rocket'
    }],
    multi: true
  }]
})
export class AppModule extends HybridAppModule {
  constructor(protected upgrade: NgUpgradeModule) {
    super();
  }
}
```

When you now start your application with `npm start` and navigate to a details view of a device it should look like this:

![Device info with custom tab](/images/web-sdk/device-detail-custom-tab.png)

You have now added a tab to a device.
You can do the same for tenants, users or applications details views.

Next you will learn how to show this tab only if a condition is met.

### (Bonus) 4. Show the tab only if a condition is met {#bonus-4-show-the-tab-only-if-a-condition-is-met}

In some cases, additional information is available only if a condition is met. For example, it only makes sense to show a location if the device has a location fragment associated.
To add such a condition, the context routes inherit the [guard concept of Angular](https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-5-route-guards).

To add a guard, you simply need to add the `canActivate` property to the route definition:

```js
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { RouterModule as NgRouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { UpgradeModule as NgUpgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
import { CoreModule, RouterModule, HOOK_ROUTE, ViewContext } from '@c8y/ngx-components';
import { DashboardUpgradeModule, UpgradeModule, HybridAppModule, UPGRADE_ROUTES } from '@c8y/ngx-components/upgrade';
import { SubAssetsModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/sub-assets';
import { ChildDevicesModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/child-devices';
import { CockpitDashboardModule, ReportDashboardModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/context-dashboard';
import { ReportsModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/reports';
import { SensorPhoneModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/sensor-phone';
import { BinaryFileDownloadModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/binary-file-download';
import { SearchModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/search';
import { AssetsNavigatorModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/assets-navigator';
import { CockpitConfigModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/cockpit-config';
import { DatapointLibraryModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/datapoint-library';
import { WidgetsModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/widgets';
import { PluginSetupStepperModule } from '@c8y/ngx-components/ecosystem/plugin-setup-stepper';
import { HelloComponent } from './hello.component';

// ---- 8< added part ----
import { HelloGuard } from './hello.guard';
// ---- >8 ----

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // Upgrade module must be the first
    UpgradeModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(),
    NgRouterModule.forRoot([...UPGRADE_ROUTES], { enableTracing: false, useHash: true }),
    CoreModule.forRoot(),
    AssetsNavigatorModule,
    ReportsModule,
    NgUpgradeModule,
    DashboardUpgradeModule,
    CockpitDashboardModule,
    SensorPhoneModule,
    ReportDashboardModule,
    BinaryFileDownloadModule
  ],
  declarations: [HelloComponent],
  entryComponents: [HelloComponent],
  providers: [

    // ---- 8< added part ----
    HelloGuard,
    // ---- >8 ----

    {
    provide: HOOK_ROUTE,
    useValue: [{
      context: ViewContext.Device,
      path: 'hello',
      component: HelloComponent,
      label: 'hello',
      priority: 100,
      icon: 'rocket',

      // ---- 8< added part ----
      canActivate: [HelloGuard]
      // ---- >8 ----

    }],
    multi: true
  }]
})
export class AppModule extends HybridAppModule {
  constructor(protected upgrade: NgUpgradeModule) {
    super();
  }
}
```

Now you can write a guard which checks a certain condition. If it resolves to true, the tab will be shown, otherwise not.

A guard to check for a certain fragment on a device can look like *hello.guard.ts*:

```js
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class HelloGuard implements CanActivate {

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean {
    const contextData = route.data.contextData || route.parent.data.contextData;          // 1.
    const { 'acme_HelloWorld': helloWorldFragment } = contextData;                        // 2.
    return !!helloWorldFragment;
  }
}
```

Explanation of the above numbers:

 1. This is the only part which is not aligned with the Angular router. In a context route, `CanActivate` will be called twice, once when the parent route is activated and once when the child route is activated. The first call checks if the tab should be shown at all, while the second call checks if the user is allowed to navigate to it. Hence, the `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` is different in both calls and you must resolve the `contextData` in the second case from the parent.
 2. Checks if the `acme_HelloWorld` fragment is set on the context.

If you now post a device with the fragment `"acme_HelloWorld": {}` to the API, the **Hello** tab will only be shown for that device and not for others.

### Conclusion {#conclusion}

Context routes help you to extend existing routes with further information.

At the same time, the concept allows the application to be consistent since the context is just resolved once and if the context is not found, it can be handled by the parent.

However, there is currently no default way of abstracting the context route concept and implementing your own.
Since the concept is heavily based on [Angular routing](https://angular.io/guide/router) you can implement the concept yourself.
