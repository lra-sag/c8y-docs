This section lists common how-to recipes for the Web SDK. It requires:

 - a basic understanding of Angular components, services and modules.
 - an understanding on how to scaffold an application and how to run it with the [@c8y/cli](/web/development-tools/#c8y-cli).
 - a basic understanding of the extension points concepts of the [@c8y/ngx-components](/web/libraries/#extension-points).

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
All recipes are written with a particular version of Web SDK for Angular. The version is mentioned at the top of the recipe. It is not recommended to use an older version for a recipe, as some of the mentioned features might not be available. If you use a newer version, you might face naming or import changes. We will update the recipes if there are conceptual revisions but not for small variations. Check out the tutorial application with `c8ycli new my-app tutorial` to have an up-to-date example of all concepts.
