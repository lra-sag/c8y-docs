Before you register a device, you must configure the Sigfox Cloud credentials in the **Connectivity** page in the Administration application. You must set up these Sigfox Cloud credentials in Sigfox.

Before you create API access to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, you must have an "Associated user" which is added to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} group in Sigfox Cloud and has the following profiles:

- Customer [R]
- Device Manager [W]

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
Without the profiles described below, the required Sigfox API access can not be set up.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

### Step 1 {#step-1}

If you already have an associated user make sure it has the profiles mentioned below and proceed to step 2.

The group name is not constrained. "Cumulocity" is used as a sample group name throughout the remaining steps.

First, enter into your Sigfox Cloud account and create a new user. Add the user to the group and select the "Customer [R]" and "Device Manager [W]" profiles.

### Step 2 {#step-2}

After creating an "Associated user" with the proper group and profiles navigate to the **Groups** page. In the **API access** tab, create a new entry and add the following profiles:

- Customer [R]
- Device Manager [W]

### Step 3 {#step-3}

After the API access entry has been created, you can connect your Sigfox Cloud account to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} via the **Connectivity** page in the Administration application. Navigate to the **Connectivity** page and switch to the **Sigfox provider settings** tab.

The **Connectivity** tab facilitates creating, updating, and deleting multiple Sigfox connections.

The following information must be provided in order to create a connection:

- **Name**: Name of the Sigfox connection being created.
- **Description**: Description of the Sigfox connection being created.
- **Login:** The login token is located in the API access entry in the Sigfox Cloud.
- **Password:** The password token is located in the API access entry in the Sigfox Cloud next to **Password**.
- **Parent Group ID:** This ID is written in your URL when you are logged into your Sigfox account and you have selected the "Cumulocity" group. For example, *https://backend.sigfox.com/group/**9823ruj29j9d2j9828hd8**/info*.
- **Base URL:** URL that points to the Sigfox Cloud account.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The group name in the screenshot below is only an example. It does not necessarily have to be "Cumulocity".
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Click **Save**. If you have entered the correct information, the message "Credentials successfully saved" will be displayed.

To add another connection, click **Add Connection** and follow the steps above.

### To update a connection {#to-update-a-connection}

Click the link to download the file with the details of the associated devices: `/service/<agent-context-path>/lns-connection/<lns-connection-name>/device`".

#### Authentication to the Sigfox platform failed {#authentication-to-the-sigfox-platform-failed}

Authentication to the Sigfox platform failed. Check if the Parent group ID and/or the credentials are correct.

To resolve this, provide a correct baseUrl or parent group ID or username or password and try again.
