Steps to build the example codec `lora-codec-lansitec` microservice.

1. Clone the https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples.git repository.
2. Build the microservice using `mvn clean install`. This creates a ZIP file of the lanitec codec microservice.
3. Deploy the microservice by uploading the ZIP file using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Administration UI.
4. Open the Device management application. Under **Device protocols**, you should now see the device protocols with type "lpwan" created by the lansitec codec microservice.

The image below shows the device protocols option in the Device management application.

The image below shows an example of the device protocols created by the custom codec microservice on subscription.

The created device protocols will be listed in the dropdown during the device registration of LPWAN with any of the LPWAN agents.
The Actility LoRa device registration is shown below.

You can also assign the device protocol from the **LPWAN** device tab.
To do so, navigate to a particular device.
Then, switch to the **LPWAN** tab and click **New device protocol** to view the device protocols created above.

Supported device commands are available in the **Predefined commands option** from the **Device shell** tab.
