Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is a traffic and resource-optimized protocol to remotely manage IoT devices. The protocol is standardized by the Open Mobile Alliance. For more information, see [http://openmobilealliance.org/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m](http://openmobilealliance.org/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m).

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
{{< product-c8y-iot >}} currently supports LWM2M 1.1 over CoAP and UDP.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
{{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M 1.1 introduces a composite operation and a client-side "send" operation. If a sensor or a number of sensors want to send measurements to the server, they can use the "send" operation to send single or composite measurement data. The LWM2M 1.1 "send" operation makes this simple on protocol level. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} also allows a timestamp-based operation. If a sensor reports a timestamp resource object in parallel with its data from the same object, the timestamp will be used.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M 1.1 is backward compatible. What has worked on {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M 1.0 will also work on {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M 1.1. However, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M 1.1 introduces some new features which are not compatible with LWM2M 1.0 devices. If you try to run some of these features with LWM2M 1.0 devices, you may receive an error message response.

You can connect any device supporting LWM2M 1.1 or LWM2M 1.0 to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} without programming. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} expects the device and its capabilities (such as firmware update) to be compliant to the LWM2M specification. The device must support the UDP binding of the LWM2M standard.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
In order to use LWM2M, you must be subscribed to the LWM2M-agent application. If the LWM2M-agent is not available in your tenant please contact [product support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/).
{{< /c8y-admon-req >}}

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The LWM2M agent supports DTLS Connection ID. Contact your platform administrator if you use LWM2M devices that support connection IDs and if you are unsure if this feature is enabled.

Our LWM2M solution allows any LWM2M object to be easily interfaced with the platform. For the sake of convenience, we provide out-of-the-box integration for the following LWM2M objects:

- Device (/3)
- Connectivity monitoring (/4)
- Firmware update (/5)
- Location (/6)


Our LWM2M solution supports the following measurement types:
- Boolean - represented as "true" or "false" and mapped in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M solution respectively as "0" or "1"
- Float - represented by any float numeric values and mapped in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M solution as is
- Integer - represented by any integer numeric values and mapped in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M solution as is
- Time - represented by any integer or a date format that can be converted to an integer and also mapped in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} LWM2M solution as an integer
- String - represented by:
    - Any numeric values in a string format (for example integer and float)
    - Numeric values in scientific format in a positive or negative exponential notation (for example 1.23E10 or 3.57e+5 or 9.8e-4)
    - Any positive or negative numeric values starting with leading zero will be interpreted as a positive or negative octal value (for example -029 or 010) and will be stored in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} as its decimal representation
    - Any positive or negative value starting with 0x or 0X followed by any number or letter from A to F (case insensitive) will be interpreted as a positive or negative hexadecimal value (for example 0x23F3D5C1 or -0x42a3b3d1) and will be stored in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} as its decimal representation

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
If a string is mapped into a measurement and the string value does not follow any of the notations above, it cannot be parsed. As a result, an alarm will be created.

To use these integrations, upload the corresponding DDF XML to your tenant.
For arbitrary protocols, you can configure how LWM2M devices are mapped to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using device protocols. See [Configuring fieldbus device protocols](/protocol-integration/cloud-fieldbus/#configuring-fieldbus) for more information.
