YAML file and spring profiles are used for the configuration of the gateway. A default configuration file is embedded in the gateway JAR file, so you only must set the properties which are different from the default.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
When editing the YAML file, make sure to provide valid indentations.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

To run the gateway locally, the default settings should be overridden in a customized profile. To use the customized profile, create a YAML file which must follow the naming convention:

    application-<<Profile_name>>.yaml

For example, to connect to a tenant, first a profile named *application-myTenant.yaml* will be created. The following properties will be added to the file:

```yaml
C8Y:
    baseUrl: https://<<yourTenant>>.{{< domain-c8y >}}
gateway:
    bootstrap:
        tenantId: <<yourTenantId>>
    identifier: Gateway_Device
    name: Gateway_Device
    db:
# The gateway uses the local database to store platform credentials and local cache. This parameter shows the location in which the local data should be stored.
        baseDir: C:/Users/<<userName>>/.opcua/data
```

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Windows OS is used for the example.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Thin Edge {#thin-edge}

The OPC UA gateway can also be registered and operated via [thin-edge.io](https://thin-edge.io/). In contrast to the standalone mode, `thinEdge` configurations must be added to the YAML file:

```yaml
C8Y:
    baseUrl: https://<<yourTenant>>.{{< domain-c8y >}}
gateway:
    bootstrap:
        tenantId: <<yourTenantId>>
    identifier: Gateway_Device
    name: Gateway_Device
    db:
# The gateway uses the local database to store platform credentials and local cache. This parameter shows the location in which the local data should be stored.
        baseDir: C:/Users/<<userName>>/.opcua/data
    thinEdge:
        enabled: true
        mqttServerURL: tcp://<<thinEdge MQTT broker>>
        deviceId: Thin-Edge_Device
```

With the configuration `gateway.thinEdge.enabled: true` you switch to the thinEdge mode. This means that the authentication and registration to the platform will be done via Thin Edge. The OPC UA gateway is automatically registered and created as a sub-device under the Thin Edge device. `gateway.thinEdge.mqttServerURL` and `gateway.thinEdge.deviceId` are the connection information for the MQTT client to connect to the local Thin Edge MQTT broker.

### Configuration profile location on the filesystem {#configuration-profile-location-on-the-filesystem}

The configuration profile can be stored either in the *same directory as the JAR file* or in a *default configuration directory*.
Depending on the operating system, the following default configuration directories can be used:

```
Windows OS
    /C:/opcua/
Linux OS
    /etc/opcua/
    /etc/opcua/data
Mac OS
    /opt/opcua/
    /opt/opcua/data
```

The number of profiles you may have is not limited. To use a specific profile on runtime, the "--spring.profiles.active" JVM argument must be passed when running the gateway JAR file. For example, let's use the previously created profile. Start a terminal and use the following command:

```shell
java -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar --spring.profiles.active=default,myTenant
```

The command above will start a gateway with the default profile and it will override the default properties with the properties defined in the "myTenant" profile. The list of profiles must be provided as an ordered, comma-separated list. The default profile always needs to be the first profile in the list.

**Optional**: To specify your own configuration, Spring arguments can be used in your terminal to run the gateway JAR file. Multiple locations must be comma-separated. The configuration locations should be either YAML files or directories. In case of directories, they must end with "/". For example:

```shell
java -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar --spring.config.location=file:<<location>>/.opcua/conf/application-myTenant.yaml,file:<<location>>/.opcua/conf/
```

If both arguments "--spring.config.location" and "--spring.profiles.active" are provided, the configuration locations should be directories instead of files. Otherwise, the profile-specific variants will not be considered.

### Additional customizations {#additional-customizations}

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If no additional customizations are required, you can skip this section.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Starting from version 10.11.0, the opcua-device-gateway process creates the address space local db files with a new filename (cumulocity-opcua-server-&lt;serverId&gt;-address-space-pv4.bin) due to a dependency change to avoid conflicts.
The legacy address space local db files are cleaned up at the start of the opcua-device-gateway process automatically by default.
Deletion of the legacy files can be turned off by setting the "gateway.db.addressSpace.legacyCleanup" to false as described below.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

The following properties can be manually configured in the YAML file:

```yaml
# Name of the application - this should not change
name: opcua-device-gateway
# Platform location and configuration
C8Y:
  # This is the base URL pointing to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. This must always be customized in an application profile.
  baseUrl: http://localhost
  # This is an internal setting of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} SDK. It is set to true, because we typically
  # want to configure the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} SDK to always use the baseURL provided during initialization.
  # Otherwise, the gateway would use the links in the `self` fragment of the core API responses as the host name.
  # This is helpful in deployment scenarios where the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} instance is
  # reachable only with an IP address.

  # where local data is stored.

    baseDir: ${user.home}/.opcua/data
    addressSpace:
      # Starting from version 10.11, the opcua-device-gateway process creates the address space local db files are with a new filename
      # (cumulocity-opcua-server-<serverId>-address-space-pv4.bin) due to a dependency change to avoid conflicts.
      # The legacy address space local db files can be cleaned up at the start of the opcua-device-gateway process
      # automatically when the legacyCleanup is set to true, which is the default setting.
      # If the legacy files wanted to be kept or if the mechanism for clearing is not needed, set legacyCleanup to false.
      legacyCleanup: true
  # These settings configure and enable/disable Thin Edge mode (registration and operating OPC UA gateway via Thin Edge).
  thinEdge:
    # Enable Thin Edge if the OPC UA gateway is running next to Thin Edge and should use it to connect to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
    # Set enabled to false if the OPC UA gateway is running without Thin Edge.
    enabled: false
    # MQTT Server URL of Thin Edge (localhost).
    mqttServerURL: tcp://127.0.0.1:1883
    # Enable this if the MQTT client uses a single steady connection. Note that MQTT is only used to retrieve the JWT, which is dependent on how long the JWT is valid. See https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/guides/device-integration/mqtt/#jwt-token-retrieval.

### Logging {#logging}

Custom logging configuration can be set during startup by passing the "--logging.config" JVM argument. For more info on how to set up custom logging settings, refer to the ["Logback" documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).
A sample logging configuration file may look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration scan="true" scanPeriod="30 seconds">

       <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml" />

### Deletion of gateway {#deletion-of-gateway}

An OPC UA gateway can be associated with multiple OPC UA servers, and the servers can have multiple child devices
connected to them. The cleanest approach to delete a gateway is to first delete the OPC UA server managed objects and all its child devices.

The server can be either deleted from the **OPC UA server** tab of the gateway (recommended way of deletion), or from the device list itself. If the server is
deleted from the **OPC UA server** tab, then the server managed object and all the address space managed objects are deleted by the OPC UA management service,
but the child devices associated with the server must be deleted separately.

On the other hand, if the server is deleted from the device list, then the
child devices associated with the server can be deleted by selecting the checkbox **Also delete child devices of this device**. The deletion is detected by the gateway,
and the address space managed objects are deleted for the corresponding server. If the gateway is offline, then the address space managed objects will not be removed.

The process of deletion is asynchronous for both cases, so it may take a while to
completely remove all the associated managed objects. Thereafter, the gateway can be deleted from the list of devices along with the device user by selecting the checkbox
**Also delete associated device owner "device&#95;&#60;gateway&#95;name&#62;"**.

If the gateway is directly deleted from the list of devices before deleting gateway's servers and devices of those servers, by selecting the checkbox **Also delete child devices of this device**,
then the server managed object will be deleted, but the corresponding address space objects will not be deleted as they are not children of the gateway.

### Downgrade to an earlier version {#downgrade-to-an-earlier-version}

Due to security improvements, downgrades from 10.12.0 to previous versions are not directly supported.
However, if required, a downgrade is possible by following the instructions below:

1. Shut down the current version of the gateway and remember the gateway managed object ID from the devices list.
2. Send an HTTP PUT command to your tenant to reset the identity:

PUT {url_to_your_tenant}/inventory/managedObjects/{device_id}
```json
   {
   "c8y_ua_IdentityConfig":null
   }
```
3. The response code should be 200 OK.
4. Start the old version of the gateway.

After completing these steps a new identity will be created in the old structure.

It is possible to upgrade to version 10.12.0 or above at a later stage. The necessary conversion will be done automatically.
