In the **Organization** page under **Administration**, you can customize the [Machine Park Overview](/oee/oee-dashboards/#machine-park-overview). Various entities (that is, sites, areas and lines) can be created from here and can be arranged according to your needs.

![Organization](/images/oee/administration/admin-organization.png)

The **Organization structure** area reflects the structure of the **Machine Park Overview**.

The entities listed in the **Unassigned entities** area, are not shown in the **Machine Park Overview** and no calculation is performed for them.

Click the arrow icon at the right to expand or collapse the entity and show or hide its details.

### To create a new entity {#to-create-a-new-entity}

1. Click **Add a new entity** at the right of the top menu bar to create a new entity.
2. In the dialog box, select the entity type (one of "Site", "Line", or "Area").
3. Enter a unique name for the entity (mandatory) and an optional description.
4. Specify a value for the OEE target in percent.
5. Click **Add** to add the new entity.

![Creating a new site](/images/oee/administration/admin-create-site.png)

The entity will be added to the bottom of the **Organization** page under **Unassigned entities**.

Lines must be assigned to sites or areas.

### To edit an entity {#to-edit-an-entity}

Click the pencil icon next to the entity name to open the entity editor and edit the entity.

### To assign an entity {#to-assign-an-entity}

Click the **Add** button to add an entity (line, area, or machine) to another entity. You can assign one or more machines to multiple lines. This allows for modelling of setups where lines can split, join, or share equipment between them.

#### Example: To attach a line to a site {#example-to-attach-a-line-to-a-site}

1. Click the **Add** button on the site to which you want to attach a line (entity).
2. Select your desired line and click **Add**.

The line will be added to the site in the **Organization structure** and get represented in the [**Machine Park Overview**](/oee/oee-dashboards/#machine-park-overview).

### To unassign an entity {#to-unassign-an-entity}

Click the **Unassign** button at the right of an entity to unassign a previously attached entity.

### To delete an entity {#to-delete-an-entity}

Click the **Delete** button at the right of an entity to delete (and unassign) an entity.

Deleting an entity will result in unassigning all entities previously assigned to this entity.

### To rearrange entities {#to-rearrange-entities}

Entities can be easily re-organized under **Organization structure** and **Unassigned entities** by drag-and-drop. Any changes here are reflected in the **Machine park Overview**. Note that entities may only be re-organized by drag-and-drop within their parent entity. If you want to change an entity's parent, this must be done using the assignment. That is, it must be unassigned from the old parent, and then re-assigned elsewhere.
