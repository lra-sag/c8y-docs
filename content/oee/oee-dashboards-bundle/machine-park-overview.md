The **Overview** page is the landing page of the OEE application. Here you can find aggregated information on the OEE values of your machine park.

![Machine park overview](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-machine-park-overview.png)

Depending on the defined target value, the OEE box for an entity is either displayed in green (above threshold) or in red (below threshold). The particular value and the threshold are also shown in the OEE box. An arrow on the right of the OEE value indicates the current trend - OEE increasing (the arrow points upwards), decreasing (the arrow points downwards), or no change (the arrow points to the right).

New values are calculated at regular intervals. This interval is influenced by the default value set in the machine, line and site profiles. The latest update information shows the precise timestamp. If a machine is not currently in an active production shift, this will also be indicated there.

In the upper section, the average OEE for the entire machine park is shown, that means, the average OEE value of all sites for which OEE values are listed in the **Machine Park Dashboard**.

Below, the OEE for the areas, sites, lines and machines are displayed.

Clicking the arrows expands (or collapses) an entity and shows (or hides) the entities assigned to it.

![Entity details](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-entity-details.png)

The OEE value for an entity is calculated as the average or the product (see below) of the associated entities that follow in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is as follows: Site > Area > Line > Machine.

For sites, areas and lines you can select one of the following options for the OEE calculation:

* the average of the attached entities
* the product (percentages) of the attached entities

This can either be configured when creating an area, site or line profile or set later under **Administration** > **Organization**, see [Organization](/oee/oee-administration/#organization).

In the search field at the top left you can search for specific sites, areas, lines and machines by searching for their profile name.

Click **Andon Board** at the right of an entry to switch to the respective **Andon board**, see [Andon board](#andon-board).

Click **Machine dashboard** at the right of machine to switch to its **Machine dashboard**, see [Machine dashboard](#machine-dashboard).

An orange alarm icon at the right of an entry indicates an alarm within this entity, together with the number of alarms shown in red.

Orange/Blue dot - Indicates an alarm within this entity. The color of the icon depends on severity of the alarm.

Orange alarm icon with number on top - Displays the number of alarms on the machine or the production line.

Orange spanner icon - The profile within the entity is not fully configured.

Blue cloud icon with clock symbol â€“ The profile did not receive measurements yet.

White square within a grey or black circle - Indicates that the profile is deactivated and no new measurements are being received.

The color of the alarms depends on the priority of the alarms. In general, the color of the alarm with the highest priority is always displayed.
