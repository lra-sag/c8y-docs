The machine dashboard offers a detailed view about the current status and development of the OEE of the machine.

![Machine dashboard](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-machine-dashboard.png)

At the top you find the general information (such as profile name or alarm status) provided in the **Machine Park Overview**, followed by the [**OEE status**](#oee-status) section and [**OEE data**](#data) section.

By default, the **Auto-refresh** option at the top left is activated and [**OEE status**](#oee-status) and [**OEE data**](#data) information is updated automatically according to the selected resolution. Switch the toggle to deactivate it.

Click **Andon Board** at the right of the top menu bar to switch to the **Andon Board** of this particular machine, see [Andon Board](#andon-board).

Click **Edit configuration** at the right of the top menu bar to edit the machine profile in the profile configurator, see [Creating machine profiles](/oee/oee-administration/#creating-machine-profiles). This link is only visible if the user has a role assigned with the Oeeconfigurator Admin permission enabled.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
To access the OEE dashboards, the permission "Oeeconfigurator" with type READ or ADMIN must be enabled for the user/role. Without the required permission you might see error messages or not see any data in the machine dashboard.

#### Time period and resolution {#time-period-and-resolution}

In the **Time range** field you can select a time range for which the OEE values will be displayed in the [**OEE status**](#oee-status) and [**OEE data**](#data) sections. By default, this will select a 24-hour period based on the current date. The back and forward arrows will move the time range based on the difference betwen the start and end time, that is, if the difference between the two times is 4 hours, then the arrows will use steps of 4 hours.

In the **Resolution/Shift** dropdown menu you can select the resolution for the selected time period. The available resolutions as well as up to four default periods (for example, 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 8 hours) are configured during the profile creation. For more information see [Creating machine profiles](/oee/oee-administration/#creating-machine-profiles). It is also possible to directly select shifts for that machine's location as the resolution.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If the selected time frame is "last hour" you can set the resolution to 1 minute and 10 minutes, but other resolutions that are equal or longer than 1 hour, won't be offered.

### OEE status {#oee-status}

In the **OEE status** section, the values for OEE, Availability, Performance and Quality according to the selected time frame and resolution are shown.

![OEE status](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-oee-status.png)

Below these values the losses caused by Availability, Performance and Quality are displayed in terms of time and amount.

### Data {#data}

In the **Data** section, a chart is available to display the current values of selected components over the specified time frame. Each of the specific items, such as OEE, Availability, Performance, and Quality, can be selected at the right by activating/deactivating the respective toggles. A toggle also exists to overlay alarms on the graph. In this way, it is possible to correlate the alarm event with other measurements.

![Chart view](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-single-view.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The time frame does not influence the direct calculation of the OEE. It only defines the time period for which the OEE is displayed here.

### Pareto chart {#pareto-chart}

The **Pareto** chart shows the loss ranking according to Pareto. The Pareto principle assumes that 80 % of the losses can be attributed to 20 % of the causes of defects.

The losses can be shown in relation to pieces or time by switching the toggle at the top right.

If all losses are 0, the OEE is 100%. Since this is not possible in reality, as OEE is always measured against an ideal, there are always losses shown in the Pareto chart.

![Pareto chart](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-pareto-chart.png)

The faults that cause the most damage are listed first. It thus supports the decision-making by recommending the order in which the causes of faults should be eliminated.

In the Pareto chart on the right, all losses, divided into the areas Availability, Performance and Quality, are displayed and put in relation to each other. In this case, the Availability Losses make up 52.74% of the total losses. In a future version, the three main losses can be divided into further categories to better identify sources of faults.


### Alarm list {#alarm-list}

Click the alarm icon at the top to display the alarm list at the bottom of the machine dashboard.

![Alarm list](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-alarm-list.png)

The alarm list shows the following information for each alarm: ID, type, timestamp (time of occurrence) and severity.

The alarms can be filtered by severity:

![Alarm severity](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-alarm-severity.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Only alarms belonging to the OEE calculation are displayed in the alarm list. Other alarms (for example machine alarms) are not shown here.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Clicking the arrows expands (or collapses) the alarm and shows (or hides) more detailed information.

![Alarm details](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-alarm-details.png)

To delete an alarm from the list, click the delete icon at the right of the respective row.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Each alarm generated by the OEE application has a status flag "Oeedeleted", which is set to "true" on deletion. Alarms that are deleted in this way are only deleted from the alarm list and the alarm continues to exist in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. Alarms triggered by the OEE application always have the status CLEARED. For more information on the status of alarms and how to treat them, see the [{{< openapi >}}](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/#tag/Alarm-API).

### Export CSV {#export-csv}

Click **Export as CSV** at the right. The **Export** page in the Cockpit application will open.

1. Click **Add export** in the top menu bar.
2. Enter a name for the export and select the file type (CSV is the default) for the output.
3. In the **Filters** section, select **Objects to export**, enter the profile name to be exported and select it from the list.
4. In the **Fields** section, turn **Managed objects** on, and add the following columns:
    * OEE Profile > @com_adamos_oee_datamodel_MachineOEEConfiguration
    * Cumulocity ID > ID of the OEE calculation profile
    * Name > name
<br><br>
    ![Managed objects](/images/oee/dashboards/dashboard-export-csv-4-2.png)

    {{< c8y-admon-info >}}
  Column names are user defined, whereas the path is the fragment name of the managed object.
    {{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

5. Click **Save & close** to save your configuration.

6. Select the checkbox in front of your export in the export list and at the left of the top menu bar click **Export**.

An email will be sent to the user email address containing a link to the export file.

See also [Managing exports](/cockpit/managing-exports/) for details on the export functionality.
