The **Andon Board** displays and constantly updates the values OEE, Availability, Performance and Quality for each entity in the **Machine Park Overview**.

The update interval of the values in the **Andon Board** for sites, areas and lines will be determined by the default update interval of any machines contained inside it. Every time a machine updates, calculations will be propagated upwards in the structure. It is not possible to change this update interval.

For machines, the update interval is the default value set in the machine's profile, but can be adjusted by clicking on the interval at the top right, next to **Full Screen**. It is also possible to select individual shifts as the interval. The last update time is given at the top of the page above the OEE values. If the machine is not currently part of a productive shift, this will be indicated here also.
