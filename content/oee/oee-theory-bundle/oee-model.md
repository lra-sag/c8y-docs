In the OEE model the capturability of values as well as the identification of capturable values is indicated by the adjectives "actual", "ideal", and "potential" in the respective terms. "Actual" quantities are real quantities and can be measured. "Potential" key figures cannot be measured at the machine, but can be derived from planning values of the organization. "Ideal" values, on the other hand, must be calculated and cannot be recorded directly.

The model represents the view on quantity as well as on time in one diagram. To make this clear to the observer, the terms end with "Amount/amount" or "Time/time". If terms do not have these endings or if there is a special case, as with the ideal cycles, round brackets indicate whether the term refers to the quantity, time, quantity and time, or a ratio. Ratios will be indicated in terms of quantity per time, time per quantity, or percentage. The exact specification of units for quantity and time was deliberately dispensed in order to further underline the generic applicability. To show that the relationship to quantity or time is ultimately irrelevant, corresponding terms are linked with the following symbol:

This allows a generic application at many different companies as different machine measurement data can be used. The conversion takes place with the help of the Ideal Cycle Amount or Ideal Cycle Time, which is explained in [Calculation logic & variables](/oee/oee-theory/#calculation-logic-variables). All quantities described as not ideal thus refer to the real machine and can therefore also be measured directly or indirectly.
