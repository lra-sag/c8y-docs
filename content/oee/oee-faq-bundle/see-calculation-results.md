After creating and activating a profile, it might take some time to see the first OEE calculation results. For each interval the values for Availability, Quality and Performance must be calculated before an OEE value is calculated. Availability, Performance, and Quality are calculated when the interval is completed. This is determined through the reception of data relevant for the calculation with a timestamp after the end of the interval. Only after these calculations are done the interval can be closed and the final OEE result can displayed.
